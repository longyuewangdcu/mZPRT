chandler , you can 't take a slow shower in <the> <morning> because rico can 't be late .

<my> second marriage : to call the wrong person under <<oath>> <<,>> <<and>> <<a>> little of that is my fault .
third marriage .
<it> <'s> <nevada> <'s> <fault> <you> <can> 't get <married> <and> <drink> <and> <paint> <pictures> <on> <your> <face> .
divorce doesn 't matter . <i> 'll go out with him , <but> not without a divorce .

phoebe , can <you> help me out here ?
<i> 'm sorry , but you 're wrong . i just don 't want to get divorced three times .

you 're upset because <you> didn 't make <your> best friend cry ?
what , rachel and i aren 't close ? i mean , aren 't <we> happy ?
when we told joey , <his> eyes were about to fall out .
i 've been a divorce lawyer for 23 years , and <i> haven 't worked alone so many times as a client .
why don 't <you> tell me what 's going on ?
<i> 'm sorry . rachel 's the one you got the wrong name for your last wedding ?
it 's a mistake to get drunk and cancel . <i> get <it> .
<it> 's simple .
<there> must be witnesses who say you were out of your minds .
<no> problem .
<i> <need> <you> <and> rachel to explain to the judge

i don 't know if i <<want>> too many memories .
<it> <'s> not like i 'm dying . i 'm just moving out .
<we> still see each other every day .
<but> a great <change> <can> also be the end of an era .
<you> <'re> not even blinking .
i 'm fine . <i> 'm just thinking that an era is coming to an end .
but honestly , <i> don 't think six years is an age .
<it> 's important to me . maybe <it> 's not to you .
why aren 't you more upset ? aren 't you sad that <we> 're going to separate ?
won 't <you> miss me ?
i just can 't believe <it> . what ?
<i> mean , that 's what you guys do , <you> know ?
you were talking about getting married in vegas , and then <you> weren 't .
i 'm not sad because i don 't think you 're actually moving in together . <i> 'm sorry .
<it> 's confirmed . chandler 's moving in .
<but> ...
this isn 't an infatuation in vegas . this time <we> really want to live together .
that 's <it> , isn 't <it> ?
<does> <that> mean we can 't live together anymore ?
<god> , i 'm gonna miss you . i 'm gonna miss you , too .
<it> means the end of an era . i know .
did <you> get the annulment ?
<i> can 't .
i knew <it> . because you love rachel .
<it> 's not like that . it 's more complicated than i thought ...
<complicated> because of love .
i 'm going to tell her right now so she can finish the paperwork .
