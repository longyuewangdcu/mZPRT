the symposium , which focused on considering that less than <two> <years> <remained> <to> <<complete>> <<the>> <<fight>> <against> poverty , was particularly critical in 2019 .
<with> <this> <year> <'s> <work> done , <a> <stronger> <foundation> <will> <be> <put> <in> place for the full completion of the fight against poverty next year .
yesterday at noon , <i> went to the shizhu tujia autonomous county , visited the primary school in zhongyi township , visited the poor families and old party <members> <in> <huaxi> <village> <,> <<held>> <<discussions>> <with> <villagers> <'> <representatives> <,> <grassroots> <cadres> <,> <cadres> <from> <the> <poor> <and> <rural> <doctors> <,> <learned> <on> <the> ground about the progress of chongqing 's anti-poverty struggle and solved the outstanding problem of " three guarantees without worry " , and had some intuitive feelings about chongqing 's anti-poverty work .
just now , we introduced the situation , analyzed the problem , put forward suggestions and suggestions , and spoke well . below , i will make a <few> comments .
<first> <,> <accurately> <grasp> <the> <situation> <of> poverty eradication
over <the> <years> <,> <the> <strength> <,> <scale> and impact of the <fight> <against> <poverty> <have> <been> <unprecedented> <,> and progress has been in line with expectations .
in november 2015 , at the central committee meeting on poverty alleviation and development , we made it clear that by 2020 , <we> should " ensure that the rural poor get rid of poverty by the current standards of our country , and that all the poor counties remove their hats , so as to solve the overall poverty in the region " .
in order to solve the problem of " who is to be supported " , we must work hard to alleviate <poverty> <accurately> <and> <eliminate> <poverty> <accurately> <,> carry out poverty identification from village to village , set up grade cards for the identified <poor> <villages> <and> <poor> <households> <,> <and> <continuously> <improve> <the> <accuracy> <of> <identification> through " looking back " and screening and adjustment .
in order to solve the problem of " who should help " , more than 3 million cadres from organs at or above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions have been selected throughout the country.at present , 206,000 first secretaries and 700,000 cadres from villages are on duty , together with 1974,000 cadres from townships and towns and <millions> <of> <cadres> <from> <villages> <,> <the> <anti-poverty> <forces> <at> <the> <first> line have been strengthened markedly , and the " last kilometre " of accurate poverty alleviation has been adopted .
in order to solve the problem of " how to help " well , we propose to implement the " five batch " project , namely , to develop production to get rid of poverty , relocate one batch easily to get rid of poverty , remove one <batch> <of> <ecological> <compensation> <to> <get> <rid> <of> <poverty> <,> <develop> <<one>> <<batch>> <<of>> <<education>> <<to>> <get> <rid> <of> <poverty> <,> <push> <the> <bottom> <of> <a> <batch> <of> <social> <security> <,> <as> well as poverty alleviation through employment , health poverty alleviation and asset income poverty alleviation .
<overall> <,> <the> <effectiveness> <of> <the> <fight> against poverty is obvious .
<under> <the> current standard , the number of poverty-stricken people in rural areas has been reduced from 9.899 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a cumulative decrease of 8.2.39 million , and for six consecutive years the scale of poverty reduction has been more than 10 million , the incidence of poverty has dropped from 10.2 per cent to 1.7 per cent , thus changing the trend of decreasing the number of poverty-stricken people each year since the implementation of the new standards , and breaking the bottleneck of reducing poverty in the first two rounds whenever the number of poverty-stricken people has fallen to about 30 million .
while recognizing our achievements , we should also be aware of the difficulties and problems faced in fighting poverty and fighting poverty in an all-round way . there are three main types of difficulties and problems .
for example , the standard for poverty eradication is not accurate , some standards for reducing poverty , and without realizing the " three guarantees of two worries " , the <declaration> <of> <poverty> eradication , more than the high standard , such as the easy relocation of areas beyond the standard , do not spend money on medical care , no schooling is free , and so on , is unsustainable <from> <the> national situation .
in addition , work is relaxed after removing poverty , and in some cases there are cases of removing stalls , baggage and hysterics in the hat-picking counties . in others , hat-picking counties do not use their energy and material resources to consolidate <their> achievements , but rather to celebrate and dilute their efforts .
<the> <second> <category> <is> <the> <need> <for> further improvement in the work .
if these problems are to be prioritized and properly solved , they must be solved urgently and in <a> <position> <to> <do> <so> <,> <so> as not to <affect> <the> <completion> <of> <the> <target> <tasks> <of> <the> <key> anti-poverty task ; some problems are of a long-term nature , and they cannot be rewarded with a single job during the period of the key offensive , but overall arrangements <should> <be> <made> <to> <create> <conditions> <for> a gradual and phased solution .
<second> <,> <to> <work> <hard> <to> solve the outstanding problem of " two and three guarantees "
by 2020 , the poverty-stricken people in rural areas <will> <be> <able> <to> <enjoy> <stable> <food> and clothing , and the safety of compulsory education , basic medical <care> <and> <housing> <will> <be> <guaranteed> <.>
if these problems are not solved well by 2020 , they will have <an> <impact> <on> <the> <fight> <against> <poverty> .
to solve the outstanding problems of the " three guarantees " , <we> must adhere to the institutional mechanism of overall planning by the central government , provincial responsibility and implementation by the city and county .
work standards and support policies <should> <be> <defined> <in> <accordance> <with> <sectoral> functions , and screening solutions should be guided throughout the country .
i have stressed on many occasions that <we> should adhere to the existing standards of poverty eradication , neither at the highest level nor at the lower <level> .
the basic medical care is guaranteed mainly to all the poverty-stricken people , who participate in the medical insurance system . common and chronic diseases can be seen and can be seen in places , and live a basic life after <they> get major diseases and serious diseases .
drinking water safety is mainly to let the rural population drink safe water , <comprehensive> research to solve the problem of drinking water safety .
the relevant departments should guide the local mapping of the floor <and> <ensure> <that> <the> <work> <is> <targeted> .
<we> should intensify <our> work , focus on outstanding issues , each village by household to check and fill the gaps , fill the short board .
<we> <should> <promote> <good> <policies> <and> <standards> <<,>> <unify> ideology and understanding , and guide all aspects of society to understand accurately .
<third> <,> <do> <a> <solid> <job> to fight poverty in the next two years
now , the fight against poverty has <entered> <a> <crucial> <<stage>> <<of>> <decisive> <victory.to> do so , it is necessary to make a difference from the initial full-scale deployment and overall promotion in the medium term , and above all , to prevent lax and landslide .
first , <we> should strengthen the implementation of responsibilities .
it is <a> <hard> <task> <to> <build> <a> <well-off> society in an all-round way .
special posts of responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the <provincial> <level> <should> <be> <familiar> <with> <the> situation , drill the business <,> be a good staff officer and assistant , and carry out the work well .
all industry departments should focus on the task of fighting <poverty> <,> <fulfill> <their> <duties> <conscientiously> <and> work together in accordance with the <requirements> <of> <fighting> <hard> <,> <and> <be> held accountable for failing to implement their responsibilities , policies , and work that does not affect the accomplishment of their tasks .
<second> <,> <attack> <the> <strength> <of> <the> tenacity .
the depth of poverty , the poor basic conditions and the complex causes of poverty in the poverty-stricken areas , the interweaving of ethnic , religious and stability issues , are the key to <determining> <whether> <the> <fight> <against> poverty can win or not .
after the meeting , the central committee formulated the implementation proposal to support the efforts of the poverty-stricken areas in deep poverty eradication , and all sides stepped up <their> efforts , <but> <could> not relax .
some poverty-stricken counties outside the " three counties in the three regions " should <increase> <their> efforts , study and refine concrete measures to effectively attack each other , and seize cities to pull out <their> <strongholds> <,> <so> <as> <to> <ensure> that the task of eradicating poverty is completed .
third , <we> should seriously reform the issue .
the second is to carry out accurate strategy deviation , or send money hair " a hair " , or unified into the share dividend " a share " , or low security pocket " a pocket " , do not use energy in embroidery efforts .
all departments in all regions should thoroughly troubleshoot problems , ensure that all kinds of problems are put in <place> <and> <lay> <a> <good> <foundation> for next year 's work .
<fourth> <,> <improve> <the> <quality> <of> <poverty> eradication .
poverty must be lifted both in terms of quantity and quality <,> <and> <can> <not> <be> <said> <to> <<have>> <<completed>> <<the>> <<task>> <of> poverty eradication , after a year or two and large-scale return to poverty .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <improve> <the> <quality> of poverty eradication through multiple <approaches> <and> <consolidate> <the> <results> <of> <poverty> eradication .
<we> must strictly exit poverty , strictly implement the exit criteria and procedures , and ensure that poverty is lifted and that poverty is truly lifted .
<the> <prevention> <of> <poverty> <return> <should> be placed at an important position , and timely efforts should be made to look back at the people who have been lifted out of poverty , and timely assistance should be provided to those who have returned to poverty and those who have newly emerged from poverty .
<we> should explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism to stabilize and eliminate poverty , strengthen industrial poverty alleviation , organize consumption poverty alleviation , intensify training , promote the transfer of employment and provide stable jobs for the poor .
<we> should strengthen the combination of poverty alleviation and solidarity , so as to give a sustainable endogenous impetus to poverty eradication .
fifth , the policy of <tackling> <poverty> <in> <a> <stable> <manner> <.>
after the poverty-stricken counties remove <their> hats , they must continue to fulfill the task of lifting the remaining poor out of poverty , and achieve a stable exit from poverty for those who have already been lifted out of poverty .
<sixth> <,> <practical> <<improvement>> <<of>> <<style>> <of> <work> <.>
<we> need to carry out a comprehensive and strict administration of the party throughout the whole process of fighting poverty , <strengthen> <the> <construction> <of> <a> style of work , and ensure that the work of poverty alleviation is pragmatic , the process of poverty eradication is solid and the results of poverty eradication are real .
<we> should improve and implement the party 's institutional mechanism for promoting poverty eradication , do a good job in training cadres to fight poverty , and improve the sense of responsibility , mission and working ability of cadres at all levels .
<we> should give full play to the role of grassroots party organizations in guiding the masses out of poverty and become rich in fighting basins , and deepen the special management of corruption and style of work in the field of poverty alleviation , so as to put all decisions taken at the grass-roots level to reduce the burden of poverty into reality .
the vast majority of cadres working in the field of poverty alleviation bear in mind the heavy duty of their mission , exchanging their hard work for the happiness of the poor masses , some running overload for a long time , some having no time to take care of their families and children , some having overstretched their bodies to light the red light and some even sacrificed <their> precious lives .
<we> should pay attention to the training and use of cadres who have made achievements and welcomed the masses at the grassroots level .
<we> should strengthen publicity and recognition and tell a good story about the fight against poverty .
at the same time , it is necessary to strengthen the management of education for <poverty-stricken> <cadres> <who> <are> <fearful> <of> <hardship> , perfunctory and falsehood , to replace them in a timely manner , and to hold them firmly accountable .
it is a glorious and arduous historical task to win the battle against poverty <and> <continue> <to> <make> <arduous> <efforts> <to> win a comprehensive victory .
we need to make every <effort> <and> <make> <every> <effort> <to> <win> the fight against poverty in an all-round way and build a well-off society in an all-round way on schedule .

<tax> <cuts> <cut> <by> <2.36> <trillion> <yuan> <,> <surpassing> <the> <planned> <size> <of> nearly 2 trillion yuan , with manufacturing and small and micro enterprises benefiting the most .
we will strengthen the building of the party 's integrity and integrity , carry out solid education on the theme of " never forgetting the first heart and bearing in mind the mission " , strictly implement the spirit of the eight central regulations <,> <and> <continue> <to> <fight> <the> <"> <four> <winds> " , so as to relieve the burden of loosening ties at the grass-roots level .

<we> will actively participate in the building and reform of the global governance system and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind .
under the leadership of the central party committee , the central leading group for response to the epidemic has conducted timely research and deployment , the central steering group has strengthened its guidance and supervision , the state council 's joint preventive control mechanism has coordinated and coordinated in an overall manner , all regional departments have performed due diligence , and all <sectors> <of> <society> <have> <given> <their> <full> support to it in carrying out the people 's war , the general war and the fight against the epidemic .
many medical personnel fought valiantly <,> <the> pla pointed out that war workers bore <heavy> <burdens> <,> <scientific> <and> technological workers worked <together> <to> <crack> <down> <,> <community> <workers> , public security cadres , grassroots cadres , journalists and volunteers kept <their> <posts> <firmly> <,> courier <,> sanitation and anti-epidemic materials production and transportation personnel worked hard , hundreds of millions of ordinary workers silently dedicated , the people of wuhan and hubei perseverance , and all sectors of society , compatriots from hong kong , macao and taiwan and overseas chinese donated money and donations .
<the> sons and daughters of the chinese have built the towering great wall to fight the epidemic .
<emergency> <measures> <should> <be> <taken> <in> <a> <timely> manner , a class infectious disease management should be implemented for the new crown pneumonia , and major public health emergencies should be initiated at the first level in all localities .
<we> will resolutely win the defense war in wuhan and hubei and achieve decisive results . we will , through the decisive implementation of strict control measures , give support to the whole country , dispatch more than 40,000 medical <personnel> <to> <help> <us> <,> <build> <fushin> hill , lei shenshan hospital and fangcun hospital , rapidly expand hospital beds , give priority to medical <supplies> <,> constantly optimize medical treatment programmes , adhere to the combination of chinese and western medicine , adhere to the " four concentration " , and make every effort to treat <patients> <,> <so> <as> <to> maximize the cure rate and reduce the death rate .

<we> will rapidly expand the production of medical materials , increase substantially in a short period of time , ensure the steady supply and supply of basic necessities , and guarantee the smooth flow of transportation lines and the supply of coal , electricity and gas .
in response to the change of epidemic situation , <we> should promote normal prevention and control in due course .
in response to the spread of the epidemic abroad , <we> should build a foreign defense input <system> <in> <time> <to> strengthen the care and care of our citizens abroad .
for a developing country with 1.4 billion people , it is very difficult and difficult for us to effectively control the epidemic in a relatively short period of time and ensure the basic livelihood of <our> people .
we have made concerted efforts to prevent and control the epidemic and promote economic and social development <,> <promoted> <the> <resumption> <of> <work> <and> <production> <at> <an> <opportune> <time> <,> launched 90 policy measures in eight areas , implemented measures to help stabilize enterprises , reduced some taxes and fees , exempted all toll roads , reduced energy costs and issued interest-rate loans .

<we> <would> <like> <to> <express> <our> sincere thanks to our compatriots in the hong kong special administrative region , the macao special administrative region , taiwan and overseas chinese .
<we> <would> <like> <to> <express> <our> sincere thanks to the governments , international organizations and friends of all countries concerned to support china 's modernization drive and fight the epidemic .
in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases , public health emergency management and other aspects revealed a lot of weak links , and the masses still have some opinions and suggestions should be paid attention .
we must strive to improve <our> work , carry out our duties effectively and do our utmost to live up to the expectations of the people .
doing a good <job> <in> <this> <year> <'s> <government> <should> be under the strong leadership of the party central committee with comrade xi jinping at its core .
as long as <we> face challenges , firmly develop confidence , strengthen the momentum for development and maintain and make good use of our country 's important strategic opportunities for development , the current <difficulties> <will> <surely> <break> <through> <,> <and> <china> <'s> <development> <will> be full of hope .
<this> <year> <,> <priority> should be given to stabilizing employment , ensuring people 's livelihood , resolutely winning the fight against poverty and striving to achieve the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way ;
<it> <should> <be> <noted> that we have not set specific targets for economic growth throughout the year , mainly because of the global epidemic and the uncertain economic and trade situation , and because of the unpredictable factors affecting china 's development .
doing so will help <guide> <all> <parties> <to> <concentrate> <on> <grasping> the " six stability " and " six guarantees " .
" six guarantees " is <the> <focus> <of> <this> <year> <'s> <"> six steady " work .
keep the " six guarantees " bottom <line> <,> <will> <be> <able> <to> <stabilize> the economic base plate ;
<it> <is> <important> <to> <see> <that> <,> whether it is to preserve employment and people 's livelihood , achieve the goal of poverty eradication or prevent risks from being solved , economic growth should be supported and the overall situation of economic stability should be maintained .
<we> should adopt the reform and opening to the outside world to stabilize employment , protect people 's livelihood , promote consumption , pull the market and stabilize growth , and come out of a new way to effectively respond to shocks and achieve a virtuous cycle .
