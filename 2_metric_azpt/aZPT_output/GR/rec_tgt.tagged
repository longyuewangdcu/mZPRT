convening this symposium is largely a <reflection> <of> <the> <fact> <that> <less> <than> <two> <years> <remain> <to> <complete> <the> <task> <of> <lifting> <people> out of poverty , and 2019 will be particularly critical .
<this> <year> <'s> <work> <to> achieve a <position> <,> <next> <year> <'s> <comprehensive> <end> of poverty relief will be able to have a more solid foundation .
when i got off the plane at noon yesterday , <i> first went to shizhu tujia autonomous county , inspected zhongyi township primary school , visited poverty-stricken households and old party <members> <in> <huaxi> <village> <,> <had> <a> <<discussion>> <with> <representatives> <of> <villagers> <,> <cadres> <at> <the> <grass-roots> <level> <,> <poverty-alleviation> <cadres> <and> <rural> <doctors> <,> <got> <a> <first-hand> understanding of the progress made in overcoming poverty in chongqing and the settlement of the outstanding issue of " two guarantees and three guarantees " , and had some intuitive feelings about the work of poverty eradication in chongqing .
just now , you have introduced the situation , analysed the problems , and put forward your views and suggestions , <which> <are> <all> <very> <well> <presented> .
<first> <,> <accurately> <grasp> <the> <situation> <of> poverty alleviation
in recent years <,> <the> <magnitude> <,> <scale> <and> <impact> <of> <the> <<fight>> <<against>> <poverty> <have> <been> <unprecedented> <,> and the progress has been in line with expectations .
in november 2015 , at the central conference on poverty alleviation and development , we made it clear that by 2020 , <we> will “ ensure that the rural poor can be lifted out of poverty by the current standards in our country , and that all the poor counties are lifted out of poverty , so as to solve the overall regional poverty . ”
in order to solve the problem of " who to support " , we have adhered to the principle of helping the <poor> <accurately> <and> <removing> <them> <accurately> <,> <carried> <out> <poverty> <identification> <from> <village> <to> <village> <,> <set> <up> <document> <cards> <for> <identified> <poor> <villages> <and> <households> <,> <and> <continuously> <improved> <the> <identification> <accuracy> <rate> by " looking back " and making screening and adjustment .
to solve the problem , over three million cadres from government organs at or above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions have been selected and sent to participate in village-based assistance ; at present , 206,000 head secretaries and 700,000 village-based cadres are on duty ; in addition <,> <1.744> <million> <township> <and> <village> <cadres> <and> <millions> <of> <village> <cadres> are helping the poor .
to solve the " how to help " problem , we propose the implementation of the " five batch " projects , that <is> <,> <the> <development> <of> <production> <to> <lift> <some> <people> <out> <of> <poverty> <,> <the> <relocation> <of> <some> <people> <to> <other> <places> <to> <lift> <them> <out> <of> <poverty> <,> <the> <provision> <of> <ecological> <compensation> <to> <lift> <<some>> <<people>> <out> <of> <poverty> <,> <the> <development> <of> <education> <to> <lift> <some> <people> <out> <of> <poverty> <,> <the> <provision> <of> <social> <security> <coverage> <for> <some> <people> <,> <the> <alleviation> <of> <poverty> <through> <employment> <,> <the> <alleviation> <of> <poverty> <through> <health> <,> <and> <the> <alleviation> <of> <poverty> <through> <income> from assets .
on the whole , <the> <effect> <of> <lifting> <people> out of poverty is obvious .
under the current standards , the number of <the> <rural> <poor> <has> <been> <reduced> <from> 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a cumulative reduction of 82.39 million , and the annual scale of poverty reduction has been over 10 million for six consecutive years . the poverty incidence rate has been reduced from 10.2 per cent to 1.7 per cent .
while recognizing our achievements , we should also be clearly aware of the difficulties and problems we face in winning the tough fight against poverty in an all-round way .
for example , poverty eradication standards are not precisely grasped ; some poverty reduction standards have been <announced> <without> <the> <realization> <of> <the> <"> <two> <guarantees> <and> <three> <guarantees> , " and more are the criteria for <graduation> <.> <for> <instance> <,> <it> <is> not sustainable to change places to move an area beyond the standard , see a doctor without spending money , or go to any school for free .
in addition , after the lifting of poverty , the work is relaxed , and some counties have the situation of withdrawing stalls , throwing off burdens and resting <their> feet . in some counties , the energy and materials are not used to consolidate achievements , but are used to celebrate extravagance and waste .
<the> <second> <category> <consists> <of> <issues> <where> further improvements are needed in the work .
<in> <order> <to> <solve> <these> <problems> , <it> <is> <necessary> <to> <prioritize> <and> <properly> handle them , and those that can and must be done so must be done without <delay> <,> <and> <this> <cannot> <<affect>> <<the>> <accomplishment> <of> <the> <objectives> <of> <the> <campaign> <for> poverty eradication .
<efforts> <to> <solve> <the> <outstanding> problem of " two guarantees and three guarantees "
the basic requirements and core targets for poverty eradication are to ensure that by 2020 the rural poor enjoy food and clothing security , and that compulsory education , basic medical <care> <and> <housing> <security> <are> <guaranteed> <.>
if these problems are not properly addressed by 2020 , they will undermine <the> <success> <of> <the> <fight> <against> <poverty> .
to solve the outstanding problem of the " three guarantees , " <we> must adhere to the institutional mechanism whereby the central government makes overall planning , provinces assume overall responsibility and cities and counties focus on implementation .
according to the functions <of> <the> <department> <,> <clear> <work> <standards> and support policies , guide the local screening solution .
i have stressed many times that <we> should adhere to the existing poverty eradication standards and neither elevate nor lower <them> .
the main guarantee for basic medical care is that all poverty-stricken people participate in the medical insurance system , and that they can afford to see and treat common and chronic diseases , and that <they> can basically lead a decent life if they fall seriously ill .
drinking water security is mainly to allow the rural population to drink assured water <,> <coordinated> <research> <to> <solve> <the> <problem> of drinking water security .
the departments concerned should guide the localities in mapping out the numbers and <ensuring> <that> <the> work is targeted .
<we> need to intensify <our> work , focus on outstanding issues , and make up for gaps and shortcomings on a village-by-household basis .
<we> must publicize policies and <standards> <,> <unify> <<our>> <thinking> <and> <understanding> , and guide all sectors of society to an accurate understanding .
<iii> <.> <doing> a good job in poverty alleviation work this year and next
now the <battle> <against> <poverty> <has> <entered> <the> <crucial> stage of decisive victory <,> <and> <the> <way> <of> fighting should be different from the initial overall arrangement and the mid-term overall promotion , and the most important thing is to prevent relaxation and landslide .
<first> <,> <strengthen> <the> <implementation> <of> responsibilities .
eradicating poverty is a <hard> <task> <that> <we> <must> <accomplish> <to> build a well-off society in an all-round way .
the responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the provincial level have special posts , <they> should be familiar with the situation , <study> <the> <business> <thoroughly> <,> <be> <good> staff assistants and do a good job in implementing the work .
all industrial departments should focus on the target task of poverty <eradication> <and> <fulfill> <their> <duties> <conscientiously> <and> jointly according to the requirement of going <to> <war> <as> <hard> <as> <possible> <,> and hold accountable those who fail to carry out their responsibilities , policies or work that affects the completion of the task .
<second> <,> <to> <attack> <the> <stronghold> of the firm .
the depth of poverty in the deep-poverty areas , the poor basic conditions and the complex causes for poverty , as well as the intertwined issues of ethnic origin , religion and maintenance of stability , <are> <the> <keys> <to> <success> <in> <the> <arduous> <fight> <against> poverty .
after the meeting , the central committee of the party formulated the implementation proposals on how to support the <poverty-stricken> <areas> <to> <shake> <off> <poverty> <.>
some poverty-stricken counties outside the " three districts , three prefectures " should intensify their work , study and refine the measures for tackling key problems one by one <,> attack <cities> <and> <pull> <out> <rural> <villages> <to> ensure the fulfillment of the task of poverty eradication .
third , <we> should conscientiously rectify the problem .
second , the implementation of the precise square slightly biased , or money hair " a hair " , or unified share dividends " a share " , or the bottom of the insurance pocket " a pocket " , not the energy used in embroidery efforts .
all departments in all regions should thoroughly examine and sort out problems , and all kinds of problems should ensure that rectification and reform are put <in> <place> <,> <so> <as> <to> <lay> a good foundation for next year 's work .
<fourth> <,> <improve> <the> <quality> <of> <poverty> eradication .
poverty eradication depends not only on quantity but also on quality.we cannot always <say> <that> <<we>> <have> <accomplished> <the> <task> of poverty eradication and will return to poverty on a large scale in one or two years ' time .
<we> need to do multi-pronged efforts to improve the <quality> <and> <consolidate> <the> <results> <of> <poverty> eradication .
<we> must strictly guard against poverty eradication and strictly implement the criteria and procedures for poverty eradication so as to ensure the real and genuine eradication of poverty .
<we> must give top priority to preventing people from falling back into poverty , organize timely " looking back " activities for people who have been lifted out of poverty , and provide timely assistance to those who have fallen back into poverty and to newly impoverished people .
<we> should explore ways to set up a long-term mechanism for stable poverty eradication , help the poor through industry , organize the poor through consumption , intensify training , promote employment transfer and provide the poor with stable jobs .
<we> should do a good job in the follow-up assistance of relocation of poverty alleviation . we should strengthen the combination of poverty alleviation and intellectual support so as to make poverty alleviation have sustainable endogenous impetus .
fifth , <we> will maintain a <stable> <policy> <to> lift people out of poverty .
when the poor counties are lifted out of poverty , they should continue to <accomplish> <the> <task> <of> <lifting> <the> remaining poor people out of poverty , and ensure that the poverty-stricken people are lifted out of poverty in a stable way .
sixth , <we> need to improve <our> style of work .
the demand for an all-round and strict governance of the party <must> <be> <carried> <out> <throughout> <the> <whole> process of poverty eradication , and the style of work must be strengthened to ensure that the work is practical , the process of poverty eradication is solid and the results are real .
<we> should improve and implement the system and mechanism for promoting party building and eliminating poverty , do a good job training cadres for tackling poverty and raising their sense of responsibility , sense of mission and ability to work at all levels .
<we> should give play to the role of primary party organizations in guiding people out of poverty and get rich , deepen the special treatment of corruption and style of work in the field of poverty alleviation and take concrete decisions to reduce burden at the primary level .
the overwhelming majority of the cadres working in the frontline of poverty alleviation keep in mind the heavy trust of their mission and exchange their hard work for the happiness of the poverty-stricken people.some have been running overload for a long time , some have no time to take care of family children , some have overstretched their bodies and turned on the red light , and some have even sacrificed <their> precious lives .
<we> should pay attention to training and using cadres who have made great achievements and are welcomed by the masses at the grass-roots level .
<we> should strengthen publicity and commendation and tell a good story of poverty alleviation .
at the same time , it is necessary to strengthen the educational management of <those> <cadres> <who> <are> <afraid> <of> <hardship> , perfunctory and falsifying in their work . those who should be replaced should be replaced in time and those who should be held accountable should be firmly held accountable .
it is a glorious and arduous historical task to win the battle against poverty , and <we> will continue to make strenuous efforts to win overall victory .
we will work harder and be more valiant <in> <the> <war> <in> vietnam and make new and greater contributions to winning the tough fight against poverty in an all-round way and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects as scheduled .
it is a great pleasure to meet you all by video at this important moment when we are jointly fighting the epidemic and exploring the road to recovery of the world economy .
humanity is in a special historical period . the global pandemic of newly crowned pneumonia has accelerated the evolution of the world 's unprecedented change in a hundred years .

not long ago , the fifth plenary session of the 19th central committee of the communist party of china ( cpc ) deliberated and adopted the proposal on drawing up the 14th five-year plan , putting forward that the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be realized as scheduled , and that next year china will embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way . we will grasp the new stage of development in a scientific way , firmly implement the new <concept> <of> <development> <,> <and> actively build a new development pattern with the domestic large circle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other .
china has persisted in taking innovation as the primary driving force for its development , and pursued an innovation-driven development <strategy> <,> <and> <has> <achieved> <remarkable> <results> .
on the basis of market advantages on a super-large scale and a complete industrial system , <we> will accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces , build an innovation system featuring close integration of science and technology , education , industry and finance , and continuously upgrade the industrial chain to provide strong support for china 's long-term economic development .
we will continue to improve the ability and <level> <of> <implementing> <the> <new> <development> <concepts> <of> <innovation> <,> <coordination> <,> <green> <,> <openness> <and> <sharing> <,> <change> <the> <mode> <of> development , promote quality change , efficiency change and driving force <change> <,> <speed> up the construction of a modern economic system , strengthen the protection of property rights and intellectual property rights , build a high-standard market system , improve the fair competition system , and let the vitality of all market subjects fully flow .
<we> <believe> <that> <with> the continuous stimulation of china 's market potential , we will offer more extensive market opportunities to all countries and provide a stronger driving force for the stable development of the world economy .
since the beginning of this year , in the face of markedly increased uncertainties in the world economy and the spread of unilateralism and protectionism , china has not <only> <opened> <up> <to> <the> <outside> <world> , but also introduced a series of policy measures to expand opening-up , including full implementation of the law on foreign investment and its implementation regulations , further reduction of the negative list of foreign investment access , steady promotion of financial market access , introduction of the overall plan for the construction of a free trade port in hainan , intensification of the reform and opening up measures in shenzhen and pudong , and deepening the pilot project for innovative development of trade in services .

<we> took timely emergency measures to manage class a infectious diseases like pneumonia and initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies across the country .
determined to win the defense wars in wuhan and hubei and achieve decisive results , <we> resolutely implemented strict control measures and supported them with national strength , dispatched more than 40,000 medical personnel <to> <assist> <them> <,> built hospitals in mount vulcan and lei shenshan and fang tan , rapidly expanded hospital beds , gave priority to medical <supplies> <,> constantly optimized treatment plans , adhered to the combination of chinese and western medicine , adhered to the principle of " four concentration " and spared no effort in treating <patients> <,> <so> <as> <to> maximize the cure rate and reduce the rate of death .

<i> wish to express my sincere thanks to our compatriots in the hong kong special administrative region , the macao special administrative region , taiwan and overseas chinese .
<i> would like to express my sincere thanks to the governments , international organizations and friends from all over the world who care about and support china 's modernization drive and the fight against the epidemic .
in the epidemic prevention and control , public health emergency management and other aspects of the exposed many weak points , the masses have some comments and suggestions should be paid attention to .
we must work hard to improve <our> work , fulfill our responsibilities and do our utmost to live up to the expectations of the people .
to do a good job for the government this year , <we> must , under the strong leadership of the cpc central committee with comrade xi jinping at its core ,

<it> <should> <be> <pointed> <out> that we have not set a specific target for the economic growth rate for the whole year , mainly because of the global epidemic situation and the uncertain economic and trade situation , and china 's development is faced with some unpredictable factors .
this will help <guide> <all> <parties> <to> <focus> <on> <the> " six stability " , " six security " .
" six guarantees " is <the> <focus> <of> <this> <year> <'s> <"> six stability " work .
