convening the <symposium> <,> <mainly> <to> <consider> <that> <less> than two years remain before the goal of poverty eradication can be achieved , 2019 will be particularly critical .
this <year> <'s> work to achieve a position , next <year> <to> <lift> <out> <of> <poverty> <and> strive for a comprehensive official will have a more solid foundation .
yesterday at noon , <i> first went to shizhu tujia autonomous county , inspected the primary school in zhongyi township , visited the poor families and the old party <members> <in> <huaxi> <village> <,> <<held>> <<discussions>> <with> <village> <representatives> <,> <grassroots> <cadres> <,> <help-the-poor> <cadres> <and> <village> <doctors> <,> <learned> about the progress of chongqing 's anti-poverty work and solved the outstanding problems of " two worries and three guarantees " , and had some intuitive feelings about chongqing 's anti-poverty work .
just now , you have introduced the situation , analyzed the problem , put forward suggestions and suggestions <,> <and> <made> <a> <very> <good> <speech> .
<first> <,> <accurately> <grasp> <the> <situation> <of> poverty alleviation
in <recent> <years> <,> <the> <scale> <,> <scale> and impact of the <fight> <against> <poverty> <have> <been> <unprecedented> <,> and progress has been in line with expectations .
in november 2015 , at the conference on poverty alleviation and development held by the central government , we made it clear that by 2020 , <we> would " ensure that the poverty-stricken people in rural areas can be lifted out of poverty by the current standards in our country , that all the poverty-stricken counties take off their hats , and that regional poverty as a whole can be solved " .
in order to solve the problem of " who should be supported " , we have adhered to the principle of <poverty> <alleviation> <in> <a> <precise> <and> <accurate> <manner> <,> carried out village-by-household poverty identification , and set up filing cards for the identified <poor> <villages> <and> <households> <.> through " looking back " and screening and adjustment , the identification accuracy rate has been continuously improved .
to solve the problem of " who will help " , china has selected more than 3 million cadres from government organs at or above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions to take part in the resident village help.at present , 206,000 first secretaries and 700,000 resident village cadres are on duty , together with 1.794 million township and village help-the-poor cadres and millions of village cadres <,> <the> frontline help-the-poor force has been notably strengthened , thus smoothing out the " last mile " of precise help-the-poor work .
in order to solve the problem of " how to help " , we propose to carry out the " five batches " projects , i.e. , to develop production and eliminate poverty , to relocate and remove poverty , to compensate for ecological problems , to develop education and eliminate poverty , to provide <social> <security> <support> <,> <to> <help> <the> <poor> <by> employment , to help the poor by health , to help the poor by income from assets , etc .
<on> <the> <whole> <,> <the> <success> <of> the fight against poverty is obvious .
<under> <the> <current> <standards> <,> <the> <number> <of> <poverty-stricken> <people> <in> <rural> <areas> <has> <been> <reduced> <from> <98.99> <million> <in> <2012> <to> <16.6> <million> <in> <2018> <,> <a> <total> <reduction> <of> <8.239> <million> <,> <and> <the> <annual> <poverty> <reduction> <scale> <has> <been> <above> <10> <million> <for> <six> <consecutive> <years> . the incidence of poverty has been reduced from 10.2 % to 1.7 % , reversing the trend of reducing the number of poverty-stricken people every year since the implementation of the new standards in the past , and breaking the bottleneck whereby the number of poverty-stricken people in the first two rounds of poverty reduction has been reduced to about 30 million .
while recognizing our achievements , we should also be fully aware of the difficulties and problems we face in winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way .
for example , the anti-poverty standard is not accurate to grasp , some lower the standard , did not realize the " two do not have to worry about three guarantees " <declared> anti-poverty , more high standards , such as relocation areas oversize standards , medical care does not cost , free education , <etc> <.> <,> <out> <of> <the> <country> is unsustainable .
in addition , after removing poverty and removing hats , work was relaxed , and in some hat-picking counties stalls , baggage , and rest were removed . in some hat-picking counties , <energy> <and> <materials> <were> <not> <used> <to> consolidate achievements , but rather to lavish and waste gonggong .
<the> <second> <category> <concerns> <issues> <that> <require> <further> <improvement> <in> <the> work .
these problems , which must be solved <urgently> <if> <they> <are> <able> <to> <be> solved in a proper way and with a clear sense of priority , should not <hamper> <the> <accomplishment> <of> <the> <basic> <tasks> <for> poverty eradication ; some of the problems are long-term in nature and cannot be exhausted during the period of the endeavor , <but> <overall> <arrangements> should be made to create conditions for a gradual solution by stages .
second <,> <focus> <on> <solving> the outstanding problems of " two not worried about three guarantees "
by 2020 , it will be possible to ensure that the poverty-stricken <people> <in> <rural> <areas> have enough to eat and wear ; that compulsory education , basic medical care and housing are guaranteed ; and that this is the basic requirement and core target for the <poverty-stricken> <people> <to> <get> <rid> <of> <poverty> , which has a direct bearing on the quality of the battle against poverty .
if these problems are not properly addressed by 2020 , they will undermine <the> <success> <of> <the> <fight> <against> <poverty> .
to solve the outstanding problems of the " three guarantees " , <we> must adhere to the institutional mechanism featuring overall planning by the central government , overall responsibility by the provinces , and implementation by the cities and counties .
according to the function <of> <the> <department> <,> <clear> <working> <standards> and support policy , guide the location to conduct screening solutions .
i have stressed many times that <we> should adhere to the current poverty eradication standard and neither raise it to a higher level nor <lower> <it> .
to ensure that basic medical care is guaranteed , it is mainly the poor people who participate in the medical insurance system and can afford to see and see common and chronic diseases in places where <they> can live a decent life after suffering from serious or serious diseases ;
drinking water security is mainly to let the rural population to drink safe water <,> coordinated research to solve the problem of drinking water security .
the departments concerned shall guide the localities in mapping out <the> <basic> <figures> <to> <ensure> <that> <the> work is well-targeted .
<efforts> <should> <be> <intensified> <to> <focus> on outstanding issues , village-by-household item leak to fill in gaps , to fill up short board .
<we> need to publicize policies and <standards> <,> <unify> <<our>> <thinking> <and> <understanding> , and guide all sectors of society to understand accurately .
third , <we> will do a solid job of lifting people out of poverty this year and next
now <,> <the> <battle> <to> <eradicate> <poverty> <has> entered a crucial <stage> <of> <decisive> <victory.to> <combat> <poverty> <,> <it> <must> be distinguished from the comprehensive deployment in the initial period and the comprehensive push in the medium term .
first , <we> must strengthen the implementation of our responsibilities .
poverty alleviation is <a> <hard> <task> <to> <be> <accomplished> <in> order to build a well-off society in an all-round way .
responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the provincial level have special posts . <they> should be familiar with the situation , drill into the business <,> <be> <good> <staff> officers and assistants , and do a good job of implementing the work .
all industrial departments <should> <focus> <on> <the> <task> <of> <fighting> <poverty> <,> <fulfill> <their> <duties> <conscientiously> <and> work together to attack poverty in accordance with the requirement of fighting to the best of their ability , and hold accountable those who fail to carry out their responsibilities , policies or work that affect the accomplishment of their tasks .
<second> <,> <to> <conquer> <the> <hard> core .
the poverty-stricken areas have a deep poverty level , poor basic conditions and complicated causes , as well as interwoven ethnic , religious and stability issues , which is the key to <whether> <the> <battle> <to> <eradicate> <poverty> <can> be won or not .
after the meeting , the central committee of the party formulated the implementation opinions to support the poverty-stricken areas in <their> <efforts> <to> <get> <rid> <of> <poverty> <.>
some deeply poverty-stricken counties outside the " three regions and three prefectures " should intensify their work , study on a case-by-case basis detailed measures for tackling key problems in a practical way <,> attack their cities and pull out their strongholds , and ensure the accomplishment of the task of poverty eradication .
third , <we> should seriously rectify the problem .
the second is the implementation of the precision of the method is slightly out of line , or the issue of money " a hair " , or a unified share of dividends " a hair " , or the bottom of the low-security pocket " a pocket " , do not spend energy on embroidery .
all departments in all regions should thoroughly examine and sort out the problems , all kinds of problems to ensure that the rectification is in place , for next <year> <'s> <work> <to> <lay> <a> <good> foundation .
<fourth> <,> <improve> <the> <quality> <of> <poverty> eradication .
poverty eradication depends not only on quantity but also on quality , so <we> cannot always <say> <that> <we> <have> <<completed>> <<the>> <<task>> <of> poverty eradication and will return to poverty in a big way in a year or two .
<multipronged> <measures> <are> <needed> <to> <improve> the quality of <and> <consolidate> <the> <achievements> <in> <poverty> <eradication> .
it is necessary to pull poverty out of the country strictly , and strictly implement the criteria and procedures for doing so to ensure that <we> truly and truly get rid of poverty .
<we> should give high priority to preventing the return of poverty-stricken people , timely organize a " look back " campaign for the people who have been lifted out of poverty , and give timely assistance to the returned and newly emerging poor people .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <explore> <the> <establishment> of a long-term mechanism for stable poverty eradication , intensify poverty alleviation through industry , organize consumer relief , intensify training , promote employment transfer and provide stable jobs for the poor .
<we> should do a good job in the follow-up of the relocation of poverty relief . we should strengthen the combination of poverty alleviation with the support of the will to help the intellect , so that poverty eradication has a sustainable endogenous driving force .
fifth , <the> <policy> <of> <lifting> <people> <out> <of> poverty in a stable manner is crucial .
after the poverty-stricken counties remove <their> hats , they must continue to accomplish the task of lifting the remaining poverty-stricken people out of poverty so as to realize the goal of lifting the poverty-stricken people out of poverty in a stable way .
<sixth> <,> <<improve>> <<the>> <<style>> <<of>> <work> <.>
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <run> <the> whole process of lifting people out of poverty strictly according to the requirements of the party in an all-round way and strengthen the work style so as to ensure that the work is pragmatic , that the process of lifting people out of poverty is solid and that the results are real .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <improve> <and> <implement> the institutional mechanism by which the party is urged to build to lift people out of poverty , do a good job in training cadres to lift people out of poverty and attack other cadres , and enhance the sense of responsibility , mission and ability of cadres at all levels .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <give> <play> to the role of primary party organizations as a stronghold in guiding the masses to shake off poverty and get rich , and deepen special governance on the issue of corruption and work style in the field of poverty alleviation so as to translate into reality the various decisions on reducing responsibilities at the primary level .
most of the cadres on the front line of poverty alleviation bear in mind the importance of their mission , and exchange their hard work for the happiness of the poor masses . some of them have been operating beyond their capacity for a long time , some have not had time to take care of their family children , some have been overstretched and given red lights , and some have even sacrificed <their> precious lives .
<cadres> <who> <have> <made> <achievements> <and> are welcomed by the masses at the grass-roots level should be carefully trained and used .
publicity and commendation <should> <be> <strengthened> <so> <as> <to> <tell> a good story of overcoming poverty .
at the same time , it is necessary to strengthen the management of education for the <help-the-poor> <cadres> <who> <are> <timid> <and> <fearful> , perfunctory and hypocritical , to replace them in a timely manner and to hold them firmly accountable .
to win the battle against poverty is a glorious and arduous historical task <,> <and> <arduous> <efforts> <will> <continue> <<to>> <<be>> <<made>> <<to>> <<win>> <<the>> <<battle>> <in> <an> all-round way .
we should work <hard> <and> <make> <more> <contributions> to winning the battle against poverty in an all-round way and building a well-off society in an all-round way as scheduled .

for a developing country with a population of 1.4 billion , it is very difficult and difficult for us to effectively control the epidemic in a relatively short period of time and ensure the basic livelihood of <our> people .

<i> wish to express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in the hong kong special administrative region , the macao special administrative region , taiwan and overseas chinese .
<i> would like to express our sincere thanks to the governments , international organizations and friends from all over the world for their interest in supporting china 's modernization drive and the fight against the epidemic .
in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases , public health emergency management and other aspects have revealed many weak links , and the public still has some opinions and suggestions that should be taken seriously .
we must do our utmost to improve <our> work , fulfill our duties and live up to the expectations of the people .
to do a good job in this year 's government , <we> must be under the strong leadership of the party central committee with comrade xi jinping at its core .
as long as <we> face up to the challenges , firmly develop confidence , enhance development momentum , and maintain and make good use of the important period of strategic opportunity for china 's development , the current <difficulties> <will> <surely> be overcome and china 's development will be full of hope .
