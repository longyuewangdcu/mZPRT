the symposium was held to <reflect> <on> <the> <fact> <that> <less> <than> <two> <years> <remain> <before> <the> <goal> <of> <poverty> <eradication> is achieved , especially in 2019 .
<this> <year> <'s> <work> <to> <achieve> a position , <next> <year> <will> <be> <able> <to> <shake> off poverty to a comprehensive end of the official will have a more solid foundation .
when i got off the plane at noon yesterday , <i> went to shizhu tujia autonomous county first , inspected zhongyi township primary school , visited poor households and old party <members> <in> <huaxi> <village> <,> <and> <had> <a> <discussion> with representatives of villagers , cadres at the grass-roots level , cadres working in poverty alleviation , and village doctors .
just now , you have introduced the situation , analysed the problems and put forward your opinions and suggestions <,> <and> <they> <have> <all> <been> <very> <well> <presented> .
<first> <,> <accurately> <grasp> <the> <situation> <of> poverty eradication
over the <past> <few> <years> <,> <the> <fight> <against> poverty has been unprecedented in scale , scale and impact <,> <and> <progress> <has> <been> <in> <line> with expectations .
at the conference on poverty alleviation and development held by the central government in november 2015 , we made it clear that by 2020 , <we> will " ensure that the rural poor can be lifted out of poverty by the current standards in china , and that all poverty-stricken counties are lifted off their hats , so as to solve regional poverty as a whole " .
in order to solve the problem of " who to support " , we have adhered to the principle of poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation in an accurate manner . <we> have carried out poverty identification on a village-by-village basis , established <file> <cards> <for> <identified> <poor> <villages> <and> <households> <,> <and> <continuously> <improved> <the> <accuracy> <rate> <of> <identification> through " looking back " and screening and adjustment .
in order to solve the problem of " who is going to help " , a total of more than 3 million cadres from government organs at and above the county level and state-owned enterprises and institutions have been selected nationwide to participate in the village-based assistance . at present <,> <206,000> first secretaries and 700,000 cadres are posted at posts and 700,000 cadres are stationed at villages .
in order to solve the problem of " how to help " , we have put forward the implementation of " five batch " projects , namely , production development and poverty alleviation , relocation and poverty alleviation , ecological compensation and poverty alleviation , education development and poverty alleviation <,> <<social>> <<security>> <<,>> <employment> <and> <poverty> <alleviation> <,> <health> <and> <asset> <income> <alleviation> , all of which are based on local and local conditions .
<on> <the> <whole> <,> <the> <results> <of> poverty alleviation are obvious .
<the> <number> <of> <poverty-stricken> <people> <in> <rural> <areas> <under> <the> <current> poverty reduction standards has decreased from 98.99 million in 2012 to 16.6 million in 2018 , a reduction of 82.39 million in total , and the poverty reduction scale has been above 10 million per year for six consecutive years , with the poverty incidence rate dropping from 10.2 per cent to 1.7 per cent , thus reversing the trend of the number of poverty-stricken people decreasing year by year since the implementation of the previous new poverty reduction standards , and breaking the bottleneck that every time the number of poverty-stricken people in the first two rounds of poverty reduction is reduced to around 30 million .
while recognizing our achievements , we also need to be clearly aware of the difficulties and problems we face in winning the hard-fought battle to eradicate poverty in an all-round way .
for example , the criteria for poverty eradication are not accurately grasped , and some poverty reduction standards have been lowered , while others have declared poverty eradication without realizing the " three guarantees " . more often <,> <the> <criteria> <have> <been> <raised> <to> a higher level , such as moving to another area beyond the standard , paying no money for medical treatment , and going to any school free of charge . such a departure <from> national conditions is unsustainable .
in addition , after the lifting of the hat , the work is relaxed , and some of the counties in the removal of hat stalls , shackles , and rest , some counties in the removal of hat not to use energy and material resources to <consolidate> <the> achievements , but to celebrate and waste .
<the> <second> <category> <concerns> <issues> <in> <the> work that require further improvement .
these problems must be prioritized and properly <solved> <,> <and> <those> <<that>> <<must>> <be> <solved> <and> <are> <capable> <of> <being> <solved> <must> be solved promptly , so as not to <hamper> <the> <accomplishment> <of> <the> <basic> <objectives> <of> <the> <fight> <against> poverty ; some problems are of a long-term nature , and during periods when people are in a difficult position to tackle them , no amount of credit can be devoted to them , but overall arrangements must be made and conditions created for their solution gradually and in stages .
<second> <,> <focus> <on> <solving> <the> <outstanding> problem of " two worries and three guarantees "
by 2020 , the goal of ensuring that <the> <rural> <poor> <have> <no> <need> <to> worry about food and clothing , and that compulsory education , basic medical care and housing security are guaranteed are the basic requirements and core indicators for lifting the poverty-stricken population out of poverty , and have a direct <bearing> <on> <the> <quality> <of> <the> tough fighting conducted .
if these problems are not properly addressed by 2020 , they will <affect> <the> <chances> <of> <poverty> <eradication> <.>
to solve the outstanding problems of the " three guarantees " , <we> must adhere to an institutional mechanism featuring overall planning by the central government , overall responsibility for each province being borne by each province , and implementation by cities and counties .
according to the function of <the> <department> <,> <work> <standards> <and> <support> policy should be clear , guiding local implementation of screening solutions .
i have stressed many times <that> <the> <current> <criteria> <for> <poverty> <eradication> <should> be maintained , neither elevated nor <lowered> .
to ensure that basic medical care is guaranteed , all the poor people are covered by the medical insurance system , and that common and chronic diseases can be seen and treated with due respect , so that <they> can basically live a decent life after a serious or serious illness ;
drinking water safety is to ensure that the rural population can drink safe water , <a> <comprehensive> <study> <to> <solve> <the> <problem> of drinking water safety .
the departments concerned should guide all localities in finding out <the> <minimum> <figures> <to> <ensure> <that> <the> work is targeted .
<to> <increase> <efforts> <to> focus on outstanding issues , village by village , household by item to fill the gaps , fill the gaps .
<we> <should> <publicize> <good> <policies> <and> <standards> <<,>> unify ideological understanding , and guide all aspects of society to understand each other accurately .
<third> <,> <do> <a> <solid> <job> this and next two years to eradicate poverty
now , the tough <fight> <against> <poverty> <has> <entered> <the> <crucial> <stage> <of> <decisive> <victory.the> <fight> <against> <poverty> <must> be different from the overall arrangements made in the initial stage and the overall progress made in the medium term , and the most important thing is to prevent slackening of efforts and landslides .
first , <we> need to strengthen accountability .
poverty alleviation <is> <a> <hard> <task> <that> <must> <be> <accomplished> <in> <order> <to> <build> <a> <well-off> <society> <in> <an> all-round way .
responsible comrades in charge of poverty alleviation at the <provincial> <level> <should> <be> <familiar> <with> <the> situation , delve into the business <,> be a good staff assistant , do a good job in implementing the work .
all sectors and departments should focus on the task of tackling the difficult goals of poverty eradication , in accordance with the requirements of going <to> <war> <as> <hard> <as> <<possible>> <<,>> <fulfill> <their> <duties> <conscientiously> <and> make joint efforts to tackle the challenges , and be accountable for the failure to fulfill their responsibilities , implement policies , and implement work that affects the completion of the tasks .
<second> <,> <to> <overcome> <the> <hard> core .
the deep poverty level , poor basic conditions and complicated causes of poverty in the deeply poverty-stricken areas , as well as the intertwined issues of ethnicity , religion and the maintenance of stability , <are> <the> <key> <to> <winning> <the> <tough> <battle> <to> <get> <rid> <of> poverty .
after the meeting , the central committee of the party formulated the implementation opinions to support the poverty-stricken areas to shake off poverty , all aspects have increased <their> efforts , <but> <can> not relax .
some counties with deep poverty outside " three regions and three states " should intensify their work , study and refine concrete measures one by one , attack cities and <uproot> <villages> <,> <so> <as> <to> <ensure> that the task <of> <lifting> <people> <out> <of> <poverty> <can> be accomplished .
third , <we> should make serious efforts to rectify the problem .
second , the implementation of precision square slightly deviation , or money hair " a hair " , or a unified share of dividends " a share " , or low-security pocket bottom " a pocket " , not used in embroidery efforts .
all departments in each region should thoroughly examine and sort out the problems , and all kinds of problems should be <put> <into> <place> <to> <lay> <a> <good> foundation for next year 's work .
fourthly , the quality of <poverty> <eradication> <should> <be> <improved> <.>
poverty eradication depends not only on quantity , but also on quality . <we> cannot always <say> <that> <we> <have> <<completed>> <<the>> <<task>> <of> poverty eradication , and then return to poverty on a large scale in a year or two .
<we> need to make multi-pronged efforts to improve the quality of poverty <eradication> <and> <consolidate> <the> <results> <achieved> <in> this regard .
<we> must strictly control poverty exit , strictly implement the criteria and procedures for such exit , and ensure that we get rid of real poverty and real poverty .
<prevention> <of> <falling> <back> <into> <poverty> <must> be given priority , timely organization of " looking back " programs for the people lifted out of poverty , and timely assistance to the people who have returned to poverty and the newly impoverished population .
<we> should explore and establish a long-term mechanism for stabilizing poverty eradication , intensify industrial poverty alleviation , organize consumption poverty alleviation , intensify training , promote transfer of employment , and provide stable jobs for the poor .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <strengthen> <the> <combination> of poverty alleviation and spiritual empowerment so that poverty alleviation has a sustainable endogenous driving force .
fifth <,> <<we>> <will> <stabilize> <the> <anti-poverty> <policy> .
after the poverty-stricken counties take off <their> hats , they must continue to accomplish the task of lifting the remaining poor out of poverty , and realize the steady lifting of the population already lifted out of poverty .
sixth , <we> need to improve <our> style of work .
<we> need to comprehensively and strictly handle the party 's requirements throughout the whole process of tackling poverty , strengthen <our> work style and ensure that the poverty eradication work is pragmatic , the process solid and the results genuine .
<we> need to improve and implement the institutional mechanism for party building and promoting poverty eradication , do a good job in training cadres who are capable of lifting people out of poverty , and enhance the sense of responsibility , mission and working ability of cadres at all levels .
<we> need to give play to the role of grassroots party organizations as a battleground to lead the masses out of poverty and get rich , deepen special measures to tackle the problem of corruption and style of work in aid-the-poor work , and translate into reality the decisions made at the grass-roots level to reduce burdens .
most of the help-the-poor cadres on the front line of poverty alleviation have kept in mind the heavy duty entrusted to them by their mission , and have traded their hard work for the happiness of the poor people . some of them have been overloaded for a long time , some do not have time to take care of their families and children , some are overburdened with red lights , and some have even sacrificed <their> precious lives .
<it> <is> <necessary> <to> <train> <and> <use> cadres who have made great achievements at the grassroots level and are welcomed by the masses .
<we> will strengthen publicity and recognition and tell good stories about poverty alleviation .
at the same time , education management should be strengthened for <those> <cadres> <who> <are> <afraid> <of> <hardship> , perfunctory and deceitful in helping the poor . those who should be replaced should be removed in a timely manner and those who should be held accountable should be firmly accountable .
winning the tough fight against poverty is a glorious and arduous historical task , and <we> will continue to make strenuous efforts to win overall victory .
we will muster all our strength and <courage> <in> <the> <vietnam> <war> <and> <make> greater contributions to winning the hard-won war on poverty eradication in an all-round way and building a well-off society in an all-round and timely manner .

since the beginning of this year , in the face of increased global economic instability and uncertainty , and the spread of unilateralism and protectionism , china has not <only> <opened> <up> <to> <the> <outside> <world> but has also introduced a series of policy measures to expand the opening-up , including fully implementing the law on foreign investment and its implementing regulations , further reducing the negative list of foreign investment admittance , steadily promoting financial market access , putting forward a general plan for the construction of a free trade port in hainan , reinforcing the measures of reform and opening up in shenzhen and pudong , and deepening the pilot projects for the innovative development of trade in services .

under the leadership of the central committee of the party , the central leading group for response to the epidemic studied and deployed in a timely manner , the central steering group strengthened guidance and supervision , the state council 's joint prevention and control mechanism coordinated overall planning and coordination , all departments in the regions performed their duties dutifully and with the full support of all sectors of society <,> <and> <launched> <a> <people> <'s> <war> , a general war and a blocking war for the prevention and control of the epidemic .
<the> <vast> majority of medical personnel fought valiantly <,> <the> pla commanders shouldered <heavy> <burdens> <bravely> <,> <the> <scientific> <and> technological workers worked in concert to <tackle> <key> <problems> <,> community workers , public security officers , grassroots cadres , journalists and volunteers stayed at <their> <posts> <,> <the> <courier> <,> sanitation and disease-fighting materials production and transport personnel worked tirelessly , hundreds of millions of ordinary workers gave in silence , the people of wuhan and hubei were tenacious , and the people of all walks of life and compatriots from hong kong , macao and taiwan , as well as overseas chinese , donated money and goods .
<the> chinese sons and daughters of the same boat , watch and help each other , built to fight the epidemic of the towering wall .

in view of the spread of overseas epidemic situation <,> timely construction of foreign <defense> <import> <system> <to> <strengthen> <the> <care> of overseas chinese citizens .
for a developing country like ours with a population of 1.4 billion , it is not easy or difficult for us to control the epidemic effectively and ensure the basic livelihood of <our> people in a relatively short period of time .
we have made a concerted effort to promote the prevention and control of epidemic diseases and economic and social development . <we> will not lose no time in resuming work and production . we have introduced 90 policies and measures in eight areas to help enterprises stabilize their jobs , reduced or exempted some taxes and fees , exempted all tolls on toll roads , reduced the cost of using energy , and granted loans at discounted interest rates .

<the> <achievements> <made> <in> <the> <economic> <and> <social> <development> <since> last year and in the prevention and control of the epidemic this year are the result of the firm leadership of the central committee of the party with comrade xi jinping at its core , the result of xi jinping 's ideological and scientific guidance on socialism with chinese characteristics for a new era and the result of the concerted efforts of the whole party , the armed forces and the people of all ethnic groups in china .
<i> would like to sincerely thank our compatriots in the hong kong special administrative region , the macao special administrative region , taiwan and overseas chinese .
<i> would like to express our sincere thanks to all governments , international organizations and friends from all over the world who care about supporting china 's modernization drive and fighting this epidemic .
in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases , public health emergency management and other aspects of many weaknesses have been exposed , there are still a number of people 's views and suggestions should be taken seriously .
we must strive to improve <our> work , fulfil our responsibilities effectively and do our utmost to live up to the expectations of the people .
under the strong leadership of the central committee of the party with comrade xi jinping at its core , <we> should do well in the government work this year .
so long as <we> face up to the challenges , firmly develop our confidence , increase our motivation for development , and maintain and make good use of this important period of strategic opportunity for china 's development , <we> will surely surmount the current difficulties and give full hope to china 's development .
this year , <we> will give priority to stabilizing employment and ensuring people 's livelihood , firmly win the battle against poverty , and strive to achieve the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects ;
<what> <needs> <to> <be> made clear is that we did not set a specific target for economic growth for the full year , mainly because of the global epidemic and the great uncertainty in the economic and trade situation and the unpredictable factors affecting china 's development .
doing so will <help> <guide> <all> <sides> <to> <focus> <on> the " six stability " , " six guarantees " .
" liubao " is <the> <focus> <of> <this> <year> <'s> <"> liustability " work .
keep the " six <guarantees> <"> <bottom> <line> <,> <you> <can> stabilize the economic fundamentals ;
<we> must recognize that it is vital to maintain employment and people 's livelihood , achieve the goal of poverty eradication , and prevent and mitigate risks while maintaining economic growth . stable economic performance is of paramount importance .
<we> need to adopt reform and opening up to stabilize employment , protect people 's livelihood , promote consumption , stimulate the market and stabilize growth , so as to find a new way to effectively respond to shocks and realize a benign circle .
<we> will vigorously optimize the structure of financial expenditure , ensure that basic expenditures for people 's livelihood remain unchanged , ensure that expenditures in key areas are effectively secured , and firmly reduce general expenditures .
<we> must make every effort to improve our quality and efficiency , <we> must be careful in our expenditure , we must spend every sum of money on the cutting edge and the most important places , and we must let the market subjects and the people have a real sense of it .
<a> <combination> <of> <interest-rate> cuts and reloans led to an increase in the broad money supply and social financing at a significantly higher rate than last year .
<we> will keep the exchange rate of the renminbi basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level .
