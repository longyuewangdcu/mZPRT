<"> <whenever> <you> <look> <,> <the> <tide> is so spectacular . "
standing next to the middle-aged man , a somewhat obese businessman , with an odd curly hair , dressed in the merchant 's robe , <his> little eyes narrowed slightly , as if <he> were calculating to look at the scene before him , as if <he> were able to sell even the beauty before him .
" without it , <i> 'm afraid we wouldn 't have been able to bring the goods into the central area so quickly . "
" to be honest , i had been opposed when i was trying to expand the market , but <it> now seems that my choice was correct . "
" but , with all due respect , <instead> <of> <choosing> <a> <large> <waterway> <,> you will go from here , although <it> will save time , but the risk will increase . "
" <i> hear the other side is not at peace lately , and i think you have heard the captain warn that there seem to be some snakes around here lately , in case . . . "
the man 's face changed a bit of weight , he turned <his> head and turned <his> eyes to the mountains not far away .
the towering peaks blocked his sight <from> seeing what was behind them .
<but> <it> <is> <rare> <to> see that the sky in the distance is not blue and pure , but with a dull dark .
some snakes in the <district> <,> <aren> <'t> <they> <?>
the merchant reached out <his> hand and patted the man on the shoulder .
<"> <not> <yet> <.> "
" but what was the injury to the young man , and from <that> <wound> seemed like a lizard - but was there something strange in the north of patfield ? "
" i don 't know , my lord , but i think <it> should be a very fierce beast , and <i> <hope> <we> <don> <'t> <touch> <it> <.> "
rod opened <his> eyes .
he stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him , <his> brain fainting .
he remembered that he had previously led a team on the ruins platform and fought the most powerful boss neutral dragon of the dragon souls , and that he had succeeded in getting the first shot , and that he was sure he had received achievements and system hints , and that the last shot of the neutral dragon took <his> life away .
originally planned , rod would have been resurrected at <the> <cemetery> <and> <then> <posted> <downline> <.>
but as soon as he was killed by the dragon of emptiness , the whole world was immediately darkened , as if it had been forcibly isolated , and then rhodes lost consciousness .
rod reluctantly turned <his> head and could see the blue sky and the white clouds out of the window . where was <he> ?
<or> <are> <you> <still> <in> the game ?
at least rod can be sure that this place is definitely not his own small apartment for rent .
it was then that lot found that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages , and although <he> did not know what had happened , it was evident from the stain blood that was penetrating on them that he was not lightly injured .
this behavior caused considerable controversy in society when holographic simulation technology had just emerged , and <it> was not natural that the operating companies of dragon soul would not have known about it .
rod lowered <his> head and looked at his right hand , which was not his own character in the game , not the body full of muscles and wild nature .
on the contrary , the arms were thin and thin , <and> <the> <skin> <was> <morbid> <pale> <,> <<as>> <<the>> <<sun>> <<had>> <<not>> <<been>> <<shining>> <all> <the> <year> round .
but how did you get hurt ?
i don 't know why . rod felt as if <he> had seen the scene somewhere .
how do <you> feel ? how are you ?
rhode frowned , but did not know what to say . he turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him , which clearly reflected his face , which was not wrong , but <it> was not right to appear here .
the blonde girl blinked her eyes doubtfully , the tail of the horse on both sides with <her> movement slightly shaking <,> blue eyes clear and transparent , give a lively feeling .
" <i> 'm afraid <it> would be rather bad if it wasn 't the silver scale chamber 's cargo ship . "
" <i> don 't know what you 're fighting with , and the body on <your> left is badly hurt . <it> 's really dangerous at that time . "
<despite> <the> <chaos> ahead , rod quickly calmed down , his mental qualities as a top player and president of the world 's most powerful online travel guild .
<in> <his> <conversation> <with> <the> blonde girl in front of him , roeder learned what he was doing , and he was seriously wounded in the patfield plain , while the silver scale chamber 's empty boat was passing by <,> <and> he was rescued .
" my name is lizzie noeloo , a member of the starmoon corps , a spiritual master <,> <and> <<i>> <am> <lizzie> <.> <">
although there was no way to sort out what was going on , rhode <hesitated> <and> <reported> <his> <identity> <and> <id> in the game .
<"> <from> <the> <east> <mountain> , an adventurer . "
" " why did <you> get so badly hurt ?
what can he say , tell lizzy that <he> was wounded in battle with the empty dragon , one of the five creation dragons ?
rod did not elaborate , but lizzie seemed to know what to say , nodded , and then she carefully examined rod 's wound <,> <and> <then> stood up .
" i don 't have dinner for two days , i think <you> must be hungry , please wait , i 'll get some food right away . "
" ah , yes , i will report it <to> <the> chief , and i think he will come to see you soon . "
with little effort , kutepov placed beacons on the intended target , then withdrew with his team from the base , safely reaching the evacuation point <,> <and> <called> <for> <air> strikes .
medical soldiers , carrying stretchers , walked through the base searching for the wounded <who> <had> <lost> <their> <mobility> <.>
all the active soldiers moved <,> <looking> <for> <their> <own> <ranks> <to> gather .
saarders looked out of the window at the fire , and a sense of despair grew in <his> sluggish pupil .
muttering to <himself> , he moved the lead as if <his> legs , slowly leaving the window .
turning around , <he> caught sight of the command officer .
at jiangchen 's instigation , s√°mi seized this fleeting opportunity <,> stood in front of everyone , shouted , with the rest of the violence , people rushed to the front line .
at the same time , looking at the smoke rising from the base behind , all the servants fighting on the front were in panic <,> <and> <the> high morale fell to the bottom of the valley in an instant .
when faced with the tide of mobs , even if they had the strength to hold the line of defense , <they> had no intention of fighting any more .
watching saami starting to attack the military base with the mob , jiang <chen> <picked> <up> <his> <telescope> <,> <picked> up a pre-prepared off-road motorcycle from the storage space , and patted aisha 's back .
aisha nodded and answered , waiting for jiang chen to sit on the motorcycle <,> the movement of a sensitive cross sat behind him .
jiang chen rode a cross-country motorcycle down the hillside , took aisha to the side of the base <,> <parked> <the> motorcycle on the side of the road , shake out the laser sword from the storage space , took in his hand randomly compared two , without any effort to cut the steel wire weave protective wall .
on top of <the> <line> <of> <sight> <,> <both> <sides> were clearly stunned .
the staff officer responded first , and immediately put his hand into <his> arms and holed it out , but before he touched his chest , he was hit by the faster reaction of aisha 's head .
his face was pressed on the cover , and saarders was so stiff that he did not wish to surrender , <he> said , biting his teeth .
jiang chen grinned <,> did not care about his uncooperative attitude , free <his> right hand out a needle tube , unpolitely stuck in his back shoulder .
there was a resisting roar in his throat , and saarders stared round <his> blood-streaked eyes , but soon the eyes of the pupil were darkened .
the old man of the east palace knocked on the crutch of <his> hand , and his voice was angry .
he was a little confused <and> <did> not know why pei yee was coming .
<it> 's just a dream .
he came down from <the> <car> <and> <looked> <at> <the> <car> not far away .
lime saw him , not <picking> masks and wigs , and came down from the car .
pei yi looked up and down at her , rarely laughing , came to her <,> <drew> near her a little , low voice said , " ouch , this group of people look at you this shape , also difficult to guess is you ? "
" of course <,> just don 't want them to know my identity , so let you come , it 's not time . "
he straightened himself up , turned around , and said with a slight smile to the people of the east palace , " i don 't know where my sister has provoked the <people> <of> <your> <east> <palace> <to> kill her ? "
<where> <'s> <pei> <yi> 's sister ?
pei yi said in a cold <voice> <,> <"> <listen> <clearly> <?> <">
" now that <mr.> <pei> says this is your cousin , please take your cousin away , as for the east palace lotus stop , his name is still in my family genealogy , have not been removed from this rebellious grandson <,> <is> still my east palace family , how to deal with him is our east palace family affairs . "
pei yi originally wanted to only take her away <,> but now it was a bit tricky .
" you heard it , old woman , too . . . my brother-in-law . they have both children and give you <a> man . isn 't it not that the child has no father later ? "
the east palace is clear <that> <the> people let pei yi take away , then they will not be able to deal with their grandson in good light , so , although some unscrupulous dk forces <,> <but> <the> attitude can not be weak .
" mr. pei , this is afraid not , our family has its own family law <,> <to> <deal> with their own people , outsiders do not allow interference . "
<"> said he , the father of the child in my sister 's stomach . are you old enough to have a bad ear ?
his decision was evidenced <by> <the> <public> <expression> <of> <that> <statement> in front of so many people .
" this is not what you say , " said the old man of the east palace . <"> <come> into my east palace <,> <people> <born> <in> our home , death is the ghost of our home ! "
in the end , the old donggong <said> <directly> <,> <"> <calculate> <,> <his> name is removed , the account is destroyed ! "
pei yi gave her a glance , <"> <after> <the> use , withdraw ? "
<"> <i> <don> <'t> <mean> <to> promise me a request , i haven 't said this , i said to return home ? "
" i 'm in a hurry to return home , but <i> promise you a request is true , say <,> what request ? "
<"> <it> <'s> <the> <same> . "
the lime looked at him , " no , first <,> <no> <chain> <,> <no> <restriction> on my freedom , the second half of the month too long <,> <two> days . "
" ... " pei yi smiled slightly , " you cut the price too much , five days , can not be less , said to let others ask , others mentioned , <you> <can> <not> <speak> <without> <faith> <,> will certainly give you freedom . "
how do you feel about it ?
<love> <frowns> <and> <beeps> <to> <anger> <.>
<stare> <down> <at> <her> , bite teeth , <"> ... cunning stupid woman . "
he quickened his pace , and went to the bed , without any pity , and threw it directly into the bed , and then <he> did not wait for a grain to unbutton his shirt .
untie the belt , take off all the restraints on your body , and then plunge into <the> <quilt> <and> press it to life .
<simple> <and> <rough> <,> not at all beautiful .
<deep> <dark> <eyes> <and> her eyes to the eye , the vivid heart of the uncontrolled acceleration .
yes , for so many years together , and every time <she> looked at him like that , her heart was still like a deer , shy and embarrassed .
maybe it 's too <familiar> <.> <it> <'s> always embarrassing .
<shy> <to> <look> at the vivid blush , exhilarating and annoying words like life , exhilarating is the hormonal automatic reaction in his body , chagrin is the way of his heart .
although he liked to see her shyness , but did not like her because shyness is not awkward <,> always so reserved , not active .
" what else do <you> want to hear ? i tell you , look at me . "
at the time she heard the name , and knew that the school had such a name <,> also felt very negative .
is that guy <just> <not> <a> <nerd> <?> <how> <can> i give her something ?
i can 't help but feel good and funny . i can 't help <but> <put> <my> hand on the mouth of the mouth of words like life and poke , " said as life , how do you not heaven ? "
it was cheap and good , and <he> liked to do it best .
<it> <was> <a> <<question>> <<,>> <<but>> <the> <tone> <was> <firm> <.>
it is a tacit acquiescence to say " ... " as if <it> were a plain silence .
he <did> <not> <want> <to> <admit> <,> <nor> dared to think deeply <,> only forced himself to sit like this , convinced himself wei <wei> <just> <fell> <asleep> <,> <will> <wake> up .
xiao mo felt that only the body of wei wei wei began to rot , the superintendent would really restore reason , knowing that <he> took hold of the person , had been dead many times .
even her pale face was much better , and although it was cold , <she> fell asleep with no doubt .
mu yan jun was watching <her> <,> <her> <eyes> <were> <brighter> <and> brighter .
the <bad> <old> <man> <sighed> <and> <walked> <to> the bedside to give wei wei the pulse .
mu yanjun focused on listening , like a good student like <,> <with> <the> <eyes> <of> <a> <conflagration> of fire burning .
mu yanjun 's eyes suddenly opened wide , <his> hand already clapped to the old man 's skilful cover .
the bad old man touched his head . " <i> almost died , but i don 't think i can live long enough . he woke up without being mad . "
don 't eat not to sleep <<,>> <<do>> <<not>> <<think>> <<,>> <with> <the> living and dead do not have the same , another two days of the estimated person with wei .
xiao mo looked at the bad old man , " <you> take care of my supervisor 's life , this time if i can 't protect again , i killed you . "
mu yan jun only slept two hours , <his> eyes open .
he was startled , and <his> eyes were seldom alarmed , but <he> found himself unable to move .
mu yanjun <looked> <gloomy> <,> <pale> <and> <haggard> <face> , but full of air , let people see the cold and shudder .
the bad old man put a needle on him again , " <i> didn 't want to save you , after all , you such a person is intoxicated , save life you do not know what the world is going to be like . "
the bad old man shook his head . " no , <i> can 't help you , but i can 't help you . "
the high-speed magnetic scanning gun in white night 's hands opened fire again , and another plane was smashed by him . it was a good weapon , and he was addicted to it . the millet bag commanded himself , and the air force of the first terrorist group formed <an> <indestructible> <force> <to> <<start>> <<the>> <final> assault .
nicola 's voice grew louder when he saw that the situation was bad , and that he was not inferior , and said , " lord , retreat , and go on like that , and <<we>> shall lose all our strength . "
louis 's fist was so tight that <he> could not see what was happening , his face cloudy and full of rage .
but he was not willing to , so was beaten back , clearly near , <he> can catch <them> again , fall short , really bad .
" babe , are they going to retreat <,> <pursue> ? " the white night laughed , and he was very fond of the magnetic scanner , holding it as if he were holding a child , with a dull and dangerous laugh at the corners of <his> lips .
the milkbag smiled gracefully and ordered to stop the attack , a quiet <,> slow passage in the dark eyes : <"> <don> 't chase , so let him die , it is a pity that the cat and mouse game , just started . "
white night smile <,> chic cuff , " cheng , no chase , <we> have the capital to accompany him to play , maybe not yet they do , louis someone is in a hurry to pack up . "
black eagles and other people abandoned the power of nine oxen and two tigers to drag ye sanxiao and cheng anya dragged up , they all knew cheng anya had a virus on his body <,> <had> long done protective measures , ye sanlitao also warned themselves have a virus , black eagles and other people are more careful .
ye three <lie> <down> <,> <gasp> <like> <a> <cow> , can not help kicking miss cheng , " little anya , you have to lose weight ah , dead . "
his whole shoulders were a little jagged , for he had swam long in the sea , consumed a lot of physical energy , and then hung such a fluttering as cheng anya , but it was enough to rebound <his> arms .
almost didn 't catch her and threw her off the sea . <<he>> still felt a little thriller when he remembered the picture .
cheng anya wiped <her> hair with a towel from the black eagle , wrapped his cold body in a blanket , his ears automatically shielded his words , it was safe , <she> sneezed , could not help but wrap her body tightly .
cheng anya continued to carry on the virtues of silence is gold , the black eagle found two sets <of> <clothes> <for> <them> <,> <because> <it> was a man 's clothes , it was funny to wear miss cheng , she simply wrapped herself in blankets .
as soon as <she> changed her clothes , the black eagle told her that she would rather talk to her .
<"> <hey> <<,>> <<mommy>> <<,>> <miss> <baby> <?> <">
little milk bag sat on <the> <sofa> <,> <smiling> <and> <chatting> <with> cheng anya , for <a> <long> <time> <did> <not> <listen> <to> her mother 's voice <,> strange miss .
cheng anya cold humming , showing a fierce tone , " you are too food , so late to find mommy , should fight . "
ning ning thought of the promise <,> <my> heart , turned to smile , " ok , baby hit , <when> <you> <return> <to> <rome> <,> <you> love how to hit , but i really think mommy , mommy you too <do> <not> <hurt> <<me>> <,> <despise> <you> . "
" <i> don 't know . "
" no , i 'm fine , nothing at all , don 't worry , " ningning said , smiling . " mommy , the plane is about to land <,> " said ning .
the little milk bag closed the communication device , cheng anya drinking hot water warm body , ye sanlitun originally looked at and could talk with <his> son two sentences , but did not talk to hang up , <he> was very dissatisfied , his eyes complained to see cheng anya .
miss cheng quietly ignored him , the black eagle laughed , " three little , the plane is fast to <land> <,> <a> <moment> <can> <see> <the> young master . "
cheng <anya> <scolded> <,> <gave> <<him>> <the> <hot> water , ye three closed miss cheng 's cup , and drank the rest of the hot water , this time if a bit of wine warm body would be more wonderful .
the plane soon landed , all landed in the castle , chu left , ye wei , xi and so on <,> <at> <the> sight of ye sanxiao and cheng anya safe , the people were relieved .
" three <brothers> <,> <sister-in-law> <,> <but> <really> <embarrassed> ah . . . "
<how> <could> <it> <happen> <again> <after> such a great deal of effort ?
the little milkbag was happy to embrace the elegant , but she was forced to drink , the little milkbag this thought , his mother had a virus , black eagle already said , and then <he> looked at the hands of father and mother together , a little deep in <his> mind .
white night wrists twisting , smile chic and gentle , " jason , <again> <shouts> <a> <little> <white> <try> <?> "
" . . . come on , what 's the matter with the old man calling <you> little white ? it was little white . you called black jack little iron . "
<especially> that pair of blue eyes , like sapphire dazzling .
<<angry>> <,> <there> <was> <a> <shuddering> <flame> , like a volcanic eruption , there was a very exuberant bully .
black jack on one side is a young man in his twenties , born very refined , he is a mixture of chinese and english , the five officials have the orientals mysteries , the westerners deep , a pair of gray blue eyes , always haze hazy look , give a kind of affectionate illusion , but look carefully , you will find that <he> is extremely keen , there is a deep hidden introspection .
the leaders of the first terrorist organization , both small in age and very different in character , <but> that is very strong , one person has a kind of monstrous momentum , let alone the three big capitals here .
the eleventh hummed , " what 's wrong , little white , little white , hit him . "
ye wei looked at them , shook her head , " three brothers , sister-in-law , do not take care of them , you still have a hot bath , a little check , lest <you> be ill . "
jason clutched the little milk bag in <his> arms , and hugged , " baby , you can rest assured that the little white dead can save , don 't say the living person , you worry about the fart <,> free to come to give me the mafia protection . "
the millet bag was hugged <by> <the> <tall> <man> <,> <strangely> <tangled> , kicked jason , " let me down . "
" ning ning , wait for me to check them to be sure , you don 't worry first , " said the white night <,> rubbing the head of the <milkbag> <,> <"> <<i>> <promise> <to> <do> my best . "
little milk bag just lost promise , parents life and death can not be guaranteed , no matter how calm is upset , <<he>> can no longer lose them , white night is very clear of <his> current psychology .
" it 's done , " said yevi . " there <'s> <no> <problem> <in> <the> <world> <.> <since> <louis> <can> <develop> <the> <virus> , there must be antidote , no solution , no solution , no , no , no , no , no , no , no <,> <no> <,> <no> <,> <no> <,> <no> .
" louis is not in a hurry , " said the little milkman slowly , with a dangerous arc on <his> face , and <his> dark eyes were a ray of reckoning . " it is one thing to win the highest state without war , and he has a <personal> <vengeance> <with> <us> <,> <but> <the> battle between the mafia and the terrorist organizations is another .
we must spend a lot of money and material to annihilate the mafia .
although he knew that he was always dark and insidious , because he was too young , people would never indulge , <plus> <a> long appearance of tender powder , always let people ignore his essence .
" i agree with ning ning , " chu said . he and the white night always agreed with his idea , <"> once and for all , so that no one will never know how thick , always provocative . "
" ning ning , when did you <refute> <ah> <,> <in> <collusion> <.> <">
black jack laughed . " but this time , it 's time for the mafia to learn a little , and let him see that <we> 're all going around for fifty years . "
they all floated a touch of the same face in their hearts <,> is the ink ye and ink you ?
in the mafia , they were the only ones who had enough appeal and mystery to think of no one else but them , and who could have the courage to be a man above lewis , and there was no reason to listen to him .
the people moved to the living room , the milkbag to find cheng anya , just as she had taken a bath , drank a cup of hot tea , warm body <,> <cheeks> <rose> <two> <pinkish> <,> <in> bed , <looking> <thoughtfully> <at> <<<<her>>>> <fingers> <.>
the milkbag pushed into <the> <door> <and> <<approached>> <<with>> <<a>> <<smile>> <.>
cheng anya <turned> <back> <and> <squinted> <and> <<said>> <<,>> <"> <baby> , you really have the norm . "
this <dress> <,> <real> <ya> <has> <the> <momentum> , where there is a little child taste <,> <the> whole is a dangerous person .
<"> <thank> <you> <so> <much> <.> "
<cheng> <anya> <pointed> <to> <the> opposite sofa , " sit there . "
cheng anya smiled , looked at the small milk bag , <she> always felt the child somewhere different , although it looked like nothing in the past , but the mother was the most <aware> <of> his child , <he> had any changes , no matter how well hidden , she could <feel> .
" mommy , how do you look at me like that ? do <you> think the <baby> <is> handsome ? "
little milk <<bag>> <<naughty>> <<blink>> <<eyes>> <<,>> <<look>> <<very>> cute .
cheng anya looked at him with a smile , " your father 's narcissistic kung fu you have learned eight or nine points , this time , you are okay , tell mommy the truth <?> <is> it bullied ? "
the milkbag shook <his> head . no .
" nonsense , louis showed <me> <the> picture , and it was blood . "
<thinking> <of> <<all>> <<that>> <he> <had> <ever> <met> <,> cheng anya hated extremely louis .
<the> <bright> <face> <,> <covered> <with> a coagulation of color , the thought of the little milk bag had been experienced , <she> had a worse premonition .
the millet bag smiled gracefully , took <up> <its> sleeves , and showed a white , tender arm , " look , there is no scar . "
the bullet wound on <his> arm was seven to eight , and soon he was not afraid to be <discovered> <by> <cheng> <anya> <.>
and the whips he had received were promised to stay <,> <and> <since> <he> <had> <promised> <to> fight , he did not <feel> bullied , but <rather> <a> little <remembered> <the> <pain> <she> <had> been beating .
if he could live , he would rather be beaten <by> <her> <in> <his> <life> <.>
cheng anya eyebrows <a> <coagulation> <,> <did> <not> <<miss>> <<the>> son 's eyes in a flash past the pain .
the milkbag nodded . " i 'm really okay , mommy , what 's wrong with you and dad , uncle black hawk said you have a virus . how did daddy get <it> ? "
cheng anya remembered that the worm had three brain leaves , the cheek was red again , she did not even say the desire and hope <,> <"> <don> <'t> <mention> <,> in the desert skipping an airplane , in the sea once again jump <,> <how> can not contact . "
it 's not <good> <to> <do> <it> <!> <this> <man> .
<it> <must> <be> <<taken>> <<as>> <<soon>> <as> <possible> , or the law enforcers will come .
the fire gourd spat down , the woman <again> <,> <the> <eyes> <of> <the> <black> , " what are you doing ? "
<it> <'s> <all> <the> way !
just in the crowd relieved , think <that> <<when>> <<the>> <<opponent>> <<was>> <taken> <,> <the> change suddenly burst ! star sword has come to the front , behind the dragon 's frontline has reached the neck <,> life is threatened , the woman 's eyes suddenly lit up .
<many> <times> <more> <powerful> than not previously known , the soul rose , into a huge ring of fire rose out , the fire gourd in the air appeared a thin layer of golden lines , originally only a foot high <fire> <gourd> <directly> <pulled> <up> <to> <two> feet , a number of rings .
the wind became louder and louder , and the woman exhaled the air of majesty , then , a dark red armor appeared quickly , <covering> <the> <whole> body .
<the> <head> <is> <a> <certain> helmet , covering the head , the dark red armour extending to both sides , the beautiful streamlined all the way down , curved , <outline> <female> <characteristics> <,> <shoulder> <,> <soft> <lines> wrapped , <covering> <the> <whole> <arm> <.>
the <dark> <red> <flame> <streamed> <all> <over> <the> armour , and on the breastplate there was a golden red phoenix , and the armour was not particularly beautiful , but under the cover of the armour <,> <the> <breath> <of> <the> woman had been lifted up several grades .
tang dulin blurted out , and <his> face was already full of bitter laughter .
gauntlet , yes , this is the gauntlet ! from its complexity and the fluctuation of breath , it should be a gauntlet , the ring that <appears> <on> <a> <woman> <is> <a> <tool> to store the gauntlet .
this means that the original five rings of women , the power was directly promoted to seven environmental circles .
di·ªám feng was very angry at this time , and she was in a very good mood today , especially happy . <just> <went> to the spiritual tower of heaven , to register , officially became a combat armored division .
she was only twenty-seven years <old> <and> <one> <of> <the> <youngest> <fighting> <armored> <men> <in> <tien> <ling> <city> <who> <had> <promised> <her> <a> <series> <of> <welfare> <policies> at the time of the signing .
the tower has promised that the future will assist her in providing a great deal of resources to help her hit the duo armored , once <it> <becomes> <duo> <armored> <,> <that> is the real fighting armored , has a place throughout the continent .
but who had thought that she had just come out of the spiritual tower in high spirits <,> <and> <had> been besieged by the small group of young men before her .
and their ability is quite weak <,> <if> <not> <to> <<use>> <<armour>> <<,>> <just> <really> <want> <to> do <the> tao .
<this> <is> <the> <full> state of the <armor> <,> <equivalent> <to> <the> <seven> <levels> of the soul of the strong , we can win the family ?
they don 't have a problem <with> <it> <!> <let> <'s> <talk> <about> it first .
tang dulin took a deep breath , the body of three purple ecstasy suddenly disappeared , the golden halo emerged , the halo blooms , the right arm expands , the golden dragon scale spread , at the same time , a bright star line in <<his>> right hand quickly coalesced , the armor emerged .
moreover , she clearly saw that tang dylin 's armor came out directly <from> <the> body , is he this is a two-word armour ?
although <it> is only a armour , but at this <age> <can> <have> <armour> <,> <is> <simply> unthinkable .
she was twenty-one years old when she had <her> first armour , which was also known as genius .
<over> <the> <years> <,> he has worked hard to cultivate and has finally become a real fighting armored man .
<but> <how> <big> <are> <these> <little> <guys> <in> front of you ?
<tang> <dulin> <'s> <left> <hand> back behind , has already picked up two bags , did not hesitate to plug into the mouth .
<it> <must> <be> <done> quickly .
even if only a single piece of armor , set a complete set of <sets> <,> <also> <has> <the> <ability> <to> help the requiem quickly to restore the requiem .
the left foot on the ground with a strong tread , the " boom " of a loud sound , the whole tang dancer like a copper arrow shot up , the right arm in front of the body , the body of blood boiling , the king of the golden dragon breath , <<his>> eyes completely turned into gold <,> <the> body of the blooming blood swings full of strong taste .
<the> <right> <hand> <of> <the> <golden> dragon claw <in> <front> <of> <the> body <,> <hard> <to> <shake> <the> <other> side of the flame , hard to push forward .
as a captain , he is more a force to attack the requiem , he must not now back half points , only if <he> <blocks> <the> <front> <,> <the> <partners> have the opportunity .
inspired by his bloodthirsty soya bean bag , <his> own soul , the power of qi and blood suddenly burst to its peak , all skin emerges pale golden <scales> <,> <right> <hand> <,> right arm and right breast parts , the scales are particularly glittering .
she did not escape , the fire gourd <on> <top> <of> <her> <head> <suddenly> <revolved> , the original line of fire turned into a large flaming spray , across the top of tang 's head , covered his companions , blocking the others .
in front of the other , di·ªám 's right hand was lifted and his hands were punched , <and> <his> <face> <was> <shaken> <.>
di·ªám was also startled ; she felt only a strong front coming , and then , with <a> <blow> <of> <her> <own> <,> <the> flame seemed to have been devoured , and the golden dragon 's claws were like great pliers , grasping her right hand .
the curly hair is in a good mood today . <it> <'s> <fun> <to> <go> out and have fun .
<after> <swimming> in the sea and being called ashore <,> <he> planed the sand for a while , and when he left , the <dog> <'s> <eyes> <were> <staring> <out> <of> the car window , full of reluctance .
" the south wind smiled , " don 't worry , the <next> <time> <you> come you can live directly in , then how long you want to play , every day <you> can go swimming in the sea , and small fish and shrimp play
the curly hair was happy , lying in the car began <to> <dream> <of> <a> <happy> <life> <in> the future .
his cheerful mood continued <until> <he> <returned> <to> <his> <student> <dormitory> .
when the three people left the south wind , fang called to <close> <the> dormitory door , " curl hair come . "
miso miso swung <its> tail and passed over .
<have> <a> <good> <time> today ?
<is> <that> <funny> <over> <there> <?>
the curls sprang up again " wang " , <and> <the> <tail> <was> <particularly> <stirring> <.>
it is now able to switch languages skillfully , <and> <the> pronunciation standard is also slippery .
<the> ear trembled <and> shrank the paw of the dog , thinking of concealing a step back .
the <caller> <ignores> <its> <retreat> <,> <opens> <the> learning machine and shows it a new folder with a newly purchased e-book
<it> <'s> <all> <ocean-related> books , twenty books .
<the> <exhilarating> <ears> <withered> .
<you> <know> <you> <read> <fast> , should <you> be faster now ?
" after reading the twenty books in the folder , the corresponding twenty test questions get <full> <points> <,> <let> <you> <go> <to> the sea to play . "
<"> <it> <'s> <not> <more> than fifteen <days> <before> <the> <move> <,> <"> <fang> called .
it 's all about rote learning . it 's not hard to get a full score with curls of memory and ability to learn .
after all , <it> is not long to stay in the port star , but also to call the harness , but also to take care of the port star other people , <it> does not eat too much .
calling to let the curly know some things in advance , marine life is not easy to recover to the present extent <,> <but> can not let the curly damage .
<i> <don> <'t> <want> <to> go to sea <,> continue with the learning machine as a companion !
as soon as he entered the dormitory door , the south wind saw the curly hair on the wall , the dog 's <head> <sluggish> <and> <squatted> <,> <the> <dog> has tears at present .
the south wind turned its eyes away , and went to find a call <,> <to> <solve> <the> <matter> <at> <hand> first .
as for the curly side , this is the norm , the south wind can be very light and certain view .
after talking about the renovation , nanfeng remembered what <he> saw today , and said , " to the boss , do you know the things online today ? "
fang called today to write a paper <,> <the> communication set up , there is no important thing will not disturb him .
" you know , <it> 's about will 's finished work ? "
will 's final exhibition called to see , also a high <score> <a> <+> <,> <one> <of> <the> final works of painting is curly hair <,> <the> <name> <of> <the> <neighbor> <'s> dog .
the exhibition has been over two days , plus today from the beginning of the morning fang called to write a thesis <in> <the> dormitory , he does not know what happened online .
the south <wind> <will> <be> <called> <to> <listen> <to> the information it has learned .
it turned out that after will 's final exhibition , the college placed his paintings on the school 's website , which sparked heated debate .
will successfully completed <his> refresher program last year , the short term target caller , <and> <the> final target caller 's dog .
<the> <short> term goal was long overdue , will 's " my neighbors " got hot online , and netizens joked that will was drawing like an alien .
this time , after " my neighbors " <,> <"> <neighbors> <dog> " was again on the hot list of the day .
<"> <neighbor> <'s> <dog> <"> is will 's longest study , longest study , most of <the> <effort> <,> <and> <is> <will> <'s> most satisfactory work .
the painting is similar to the previous " my neighbors " style , but <it> looks even more difficult to understand , " my neighbors " can also see a personal appearance , " neighbors ' dogs " can not see a dog , if not see the name of the painting , no one would think the painting is a dog , or a small dog .
the brightest color rendering , mysterious and breathtaking <,> <seems> <to> <be> <too> <vulgar> <,> but unable to say where wrong , the more research , the more the heart will rise a tremor .
after seeing the picture , a student recalled the <little> <curly> <dog> <he> <had> <met> <on> campus , searched the internet for a dog called by the search party to make sure <<he>> was not mistaken .
" <it> 's a little more than ordinary people understand . "
even if the layman stood in front of the picture , <quietly> <look> <for> <a> <few> <seconds> <,> even <if> <not> understand <,> <but> <hair> <in> <the> heart , the body can not resist the feeling of shivering .
" i found that will , after further study , was completely free <,> <and> thought was free , and i could not wait to understand it . "
" what vengeance and resentment <!> <to> <draw> the dog called by the party like this ! "
" the previous friend must have never seen will 's last picture . " my neighbor <,> <"> he said , and looked at will 's call-up .
" maybe will was bitten by a dog and had a psychological shadow over the dog <,> <or> <it> <wouldn> <'t> <be> <so> scary to draw ! "
" don 't blow black , i stared at the painting for five minutes , still do not realize what he wants to express , <but> <the> <unnamed> <feel> <good> <cow> <force> <,> <there> is a strange feeling in my heart . "
" <it> 's <worth> <investing> <.> <look> <at> <will> <,> he 's still young . "
the last collector from <pastoral> <state> <bought> <the> <painting> <at> <a> <high> <price> <,> <far> <exceeding> <royalty> <'s> estimate .
some people think the shepherd 's collector is too zealous about the curls <,> <and> <when> <faced> with them , the shepherds seem to be not cool enough .
<"> <in> <the> morning the test was only 62 , to protect the animal this piece to see twice more ! "
coral can 't eat either !
" <it> 's really simple to feel the breath fluctuating , " another magician on one side said with a smile .
<"> <that> <'s> <it> <.> <">
but now <that> <such> <opportunities> <are> encountered , the quickest speed to get in hand is wang tao .
the two reached out and gently touched the border of the evil spirit <door> <and> <closed> <their> <eyes> <.>
the magician quickly began building <a> <space> <base> disk with foreign energy , which was established as a coordinate .
" but we generally explore other space secrets <by> turning this peer-to-peer into more peer-to-peer . "
" this only <requires> <a> <little> <bit> <of> <modification> <on> <the> transmission base disk . "
" this is to use energy to hit luck <,> <good> luck , can hit the space <we> want to have a secret <,> <bad> luck , we have to waste energy to try more . "
at the same time , he was as divided as consciousness <,> <and> <sensational> consciousness was divided into more than ten , and at the same time he sensed more than ten completely different spatial breaths .
but he did not realize that the psychic soul , too strong and tenacious , was divided out , and after more than <a> <dozen> <consciousness> <touched> <the> <space> <,> he was able to remember all the coordinates .
lin sheng opened <his> eyes and looked at some of the magicians .
have <you> succeeded at once ?
<"> start , build a portal . "
<it> <was> <the> <moon> <that> <deceived> <everyone> !
" the seven lock towers have long been called to success , the moon deceives all three secrets , he has already successfully summon farudo ! use himself as a sacrifice <!> <blend> it ! "
<"> <sacrifice> <yourself> <?> <">
lin sheng thought of the information <he> had previously investigated .
" but <it> <'s> <better> <to> <be> <prepared> <early> , " said tiangxia .
at that time she <,> <even> <in> <the> <memory> <of> <the> retrospective , also found lin sheng 's peep .
only a memory image imprint <,> <but> can also find peeping memory of the flourishing .
<big> deal <opens> <the> strongest of that special state , summons all the dominion power , into itself .
disconnect the connection with tianzhong xia , lin sheng quietly gazes at the newly constructed <new> <evil> spirit door .
hearing the call , <he> walked in at once from the door .
<otherwise> <,> <it> <will> <not> <suddenly> be so urgent to explore on a large scale .
this is what song fu and others want to ask , was asked first , you look at me , i look at you , do not <know> <what> <to> <do> <,> <where> <to> answer out .
when they came to the door of the mountain gate , <they> saw under the moonlight that the stone carving hall , engraved with the word " donglai cave " , had been broken , and all were astonished that someone had destroyed the mountain gate of the donglai cave .
miao yi <looked> <back> <,> <his> <face> <grimly> <to> song fu and other people , chuckling coldly not only said : " ok ! "
a few people had doubted whether miao yi <they> did , see the appearance of miao yi <,> <felt> that miao yi did not have to smash his mountain door to see his own color , after all , miao yi is the donglai cave owner , just after taking office when someone smashed the sign but a disgrace .
this kind of <thing> must say clearly , <otherwise> <once> <poked> <up> <can> <not> <bear> this responsibility , song fu zhengcolor embraced the fist : " the cave owner , this is not the matter i wait for ! "
song fu for the conclusion , he did not have the root here , and now it is not good to say that i do not put the root of your cave in the eyes so did not be <in> <,> <can> only hold a fist ' honest ' to explain : " the dongfu may not know the situation , the east came to the city of miscellaneous services have not been sent , i wait for the food is their own treatment <,> <for> <the> <sake> <of> <the> <belly> <,> <the> <subordinates> <temporarily> <left> <for> <a> <while> <<,>> <<did>> <<not>> <expect> <such> <a> <thing> to happen . "
miao yi pointed to the fallen archway and said , " is this oneself fall down ? don 't you tell me , <it> was blown down by the wind ! "
song fu a little dumb to eat huang even , had to raise his hand and said , " lord of the cave , i can swear to my blue jade men of the previous generations , this is not what we did <,> if there is half a false word , let me song fu can not die ! "
miao yi 's eyes flickering through the <crowd> <,> <the> <tone> <of> <the> <gloomy> said : " is anyone come to me to come to the east to make trouble ? "
the crowd was startled , and it was possible that <they> looked around quickly .
miao yi 's nasal cavity was heavy humming , eyes glared at song fu and others , as if in question since you did not do , why not search , do <<you>> know what ?
at <this> <time> <how> <to> <make> <a> <statement> to prove and oneself and other people do not matter , song fu immediately turned around and said , " still do not comply with the dong-master order to search ! "
song fang was in a trance <,> embrace the fist said is , followed by the mong yi behind .
the old man stared at the fallen stone gate <,> <shook> <his> <head> <and> <smiled> <,> <"> <the> <world> <is> <like> <chess> <,> hot men can only have the courage of a husband ! "
" <i> have been worried that your boy is too kind and easy to suffer . . . the boy is skillful , the district reckless husband is difficult to come to the sky , now i am a lot of rest . "
<words> <fell> <,> <the> <whole> human shadow again like water wave shaking <,> <in> the shaking quietly disappeared without a trace .
<he> stared at his throne with no expression <,> <holding> <back> <his> <hand> <to> <song> , without saying a word .
song fu 's mouth showed sarcasm , glanced at the dish on the low table side of the <eye> <,> <said> <quietly> <:> <"> <this> is not what i wait for , what is song fu guilty ? "
miao yi turned <and> <stared> <at> <him> <,> <and> <asked> coldly a word , " i ordered you to guard the mountain gate , why are you free from duty ? do <you> not put the decree of my lord of the cave in the eye ! "
<i> didn 't know what to do .
of course on the mouth will not say , " <song> <fu> <has> <told> <the> <owner> <of> the cave , some real helplessness , only for the fruit belly temporarily leave , such a thing i do not want to see . "
song fu hehe laughed : " people mouth two skin , the owner of the cave not to falsely slander song , then please , but the owner <of> <the> <cave> <do> <not> <forget> <,> some also has a mouth to justify <,> not dumb . "
as a result , yan xiu , a single appearance of righteousness and qiu shao group together appeared outside the <door> <,> <together> <came> <in> <to> <miao> yi to embrace the fist said <,> <"> <the> <owner> <of> <the> <cave> <,> <for> <the> <time> being no suspicious person . "
miao yi said : " suspicious people are <in> <front> <of> <<you>> <,> why did not <find> one ! "
song fu was <surprised> <,> <quickly> <turned> <back> <,> <but> saw that the killing of god yan shu a pair of axe has been angry and split .
yan xiu and song fu 's practice is similar <,> <the> <two> <would> <have> been close to each other , together with a single epitome and qiu shaoqun joined together , the situation of song fu instantly became precarious .
under the siege , unable to get out of the body , the sword and yan shu desperately hold together song held the sad roar , not finished , was desperately piercing the two guns piercing <through> <the> <force> <of> defense , <hard> <into> <the> <chest> <.>
song held his eyes wide and tried to look back at the slim <,> shivering lips , the anger in <his> eyes could not be described .
<"> <on> <east> <campus> <?> <">
zhou tu obviously hesitated , whether the school director or the teacher had warned the new students not to approach the east campus , they did not explain the specific reasons , <but> from the tone of their speech can hear the east campus is dangerous .
chen said that some members of the community do not understand what chen said , they do not know why chen said , but feel that chen said seems to have some reason .
the curiosity of the children was so great that chen continued to tell them the truth about <the> <school> <that> <his> <success> <attracted> <the> interest of the members of the community .
if you look at <it> carefully , you will find that the shadow of the old song is different from the shadow of others , the paint is as black as ink , as if all the light will be swallowed there .
<by> <doing> <so> <,> <you> <can> increase your strength , and <then> <you> can muddle the pool of dead water and cover another " murderer " in the college .
" when you say this , your voice is higher <than> <usual> <,> <your> <voice> <is> <faster> , <your> eyes are fluttering , you child is not good at lying . "
chen ge gently put his arms around wang yicheng 's shoulder : " why don 't <you> want us to pass by ? "
" there 's not much time left for me . after checking out the 413 <bedroom> <,> <you> <have> <to> <avoid> <the> wind . "
there are four dormitories for boys in the west campus , and the number of students is several times that of the east campus . the lights have not yet been turned off . it is the hottest <time> <for> <boys> <to> <sleep> <in> <the> dormitory .
chen ge behaved very <naturally> <and> <entered> the first building with four students .
the king opened the door , and when he entered the house , the rest of the room seemed to do his own <business> <when> <he> <did> <not> <exist> <,> and no one spoke to him .
when wang yicheng walked a few steps inside , the boy sleeping next to the door suddenly opened the mosquito net and stared at him : <"> <how> many times ? "
" come in and close the door with <you> <,> <you> <lame> <leg> <,> <is> <the> ear not good ? "
" he doesn 't close the door because there are people coming in behind him . if you need to apologize , some of us can apologize for <him> <,> <just> <don> <'t> <know> <what> kind of apology you need ? "
net-net man saw chen <song> <immediately> <,> <did> <not> <speak> <<,>> <black> face to pull the net again .
" teacher white , this is the fourth bed , because no one lives , so we used to put <our> luggage . "
wang yicheng pointed to bed no. 4 and threw several suitcases on it . only his luggage in the bedroom was under his bed , and the <others> <threw> <the> groceries and luggage into bed no. 4 .
the sparrow arched <her> fist , took her life , and , half ringing , she opened the door of the bamboo house and entered , hesitating , " queen , there are two men outside , who are coming to you ... "
the feather knelt on the ground with tears on his face : " all faults are my fault , and the queen wants to scold , i have nothing to say . " he took the bamboo sticks behind <him> in his hand , hands to hand , to face the white face , deeply lowered his head , face to face death .
the fierce voice of the woman fell into the ear of the feather , and the feather immediately climbed up from the ground , and his legs were all blood , and <he> could not stand firm .
so he stood still on the ground , and did not continue kneeling <,> <even> <though> <his> <legs> <trembled> <.>
