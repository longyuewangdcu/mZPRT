Guoliang Li
The large-scale complexity, high-speed growth, diversity of forms, and low value density of big data have brought severe challenges to big data computing.
On the one hand, the complexity and rapid growth of big data have caused many big data computing tasks to require massive computing and analysis technologies.
On the other hand, the form diversity and low value density of big data have caused many big data computing tasks to highly rely on complex cognitive inference technology, which is still difficult to handle effectively by using current computing technology and algorithms alone.
In response to the needs of complex cognition and massive computing for big data tasks, the applicant proposed human-computer collaboration group computing to solve this problem. The group computing model of human-computer collaboration, quality-aware group computing methods, and resource controllable In-depth research on group computer science and other aspects has been carried out, and a number of innovative results have been achieved.
Over 100 academic articles have been published on A-Class journals and at conferences of the China Computer Federation and there have been papers published at the three major conferences of SIGMOD, VLDB and ICDE every year.
According to Google Scholar statistics, papers have been cited for over 6000 times, of which 16 exceeds 100 times. The H-Index is 46 and the SCI citations amount is 747 times.
Li was selected into the Elsevier Highly Cited Scholars List from 2014 to 2018.
And he received VLDB Early Research Contribution Award in 2017 (the only awardee in Asia so far), IEEE TCDE Early Career Award in 2014 (the only awardee in Asia so far). And Li was selected into Young Yangtze River Scholar in 2016, "Ten Thousand Talents Program" Young Top Talents in 2017, National Talented Youth in 2014. He won the CIKM Best Paper Award (B-Class Conference), the ICDE Best Paper Candidate (A-Class Conference) in 2018, the KDD Best Paper Candidate (A-Class Conference) in 2018, the DASFAA Best Paper Nomination Award (B-Class Conference) in 2014, the APWeb Best Paper Award (C-Class Conference) in 2014.

The research overcame the experimental problem of quantitative observation of flexible riser vortex-induced vibration under the combined action of platform motion and background ocean currents, discovered the phenomenon that platform motion induces secondary vortex-induced vibration of the riser, which would lead to 50 times of the fatigue damage caused by traditional dynamic response evaluation, and modified the design standards. He innovatively proposed the theory of reverse identification of vortex-induced vibration hydrodynamic load, and for the first time clarified the internal correlation mechanism between vortex-induced vibration and hydrodynamic load of flexible riser. And he brought forward a new direct solution algorithm for vortex-induced vibration prediction, which fundamentally eliminates the problems of numerical divergence and unclear physical meaning of traditional prediction methods.
He has obtained 46 national invention patent authorizations (32 of them as the first inventor).
And he has published 58 SCI papers of which 49 were publsiehd in the past 5 years.
