Did everything go okay with the annu@@ l@@ ment ?
No problems . It 's all taken care of . Ross , thank you .
Do you want to go see a movie ? Yeah , why not ?
I 'll get my sweater .
Do you want to hear something weird ? Always .
I didn 't get the annu@@ l@@ ment .
What ? We 're still married .
Don 't tell Rachel . See you later .
Do you have any gum ?
Wait ! Wait ! Ross , can I just talk to you for just a second ?
We 'll be late for the movie .
There 's a cab . Taxi !
That 's great . My God , huh ? There you go .
We 're gonna walk . It 's right at the Ange@@ li@@ ka .
The Ange@@ li@@ ka ! Go ! Go !
You didn 't get the annu@@ l@@ ment ? ! I know .
Ross ？
I tried , but when I got to my lawyer 's office , all I heard was :
" Three divor@@ ces ! Three divor@@ ces ! "
Yes , in that high voice .
I just don 't want my tom@@ bstone to read : " Ross Geller : Three Divor@@ ces . "
Don 't worry about that . Your tom@@ bstone can say whatever you want .
It can say , " Ross Geller : Good at Marriage . "
You know ? Mine 's gonna say , " Phoebe Buff@@ ay : Buried Alive . "
All I know is , I can 't have another failed marriage .
So you 're gonna be married to a girl who doesn 't even know about it ?
Woman . Sorry .
Okay , so I don 't have it all worked out quite yet . Just don 't say anything to Rachel .
Rachel is one of my closest friends .
But being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special . Okay .
Okay , stop , stop !
Phoebe ? Hey , Rach !
What was that ? Sorry . Mi@@ x@@ -up .
How was the movie ? I haven 't seen it yet .
You 'd better hurry . The Ange@@ li@@ ka ! Go !
No
The One Where Ross Hu@@ gs Rachel
When I move in , can I get a gu@@ mball machine ?
Of course . Joey wouldn 't let you have one ?
No , when it comes to sweets , he 's surprisingly strict .
Did you tell him you 're moving out ? No , I keep trying .
And I can get out , " Joey , I have to ... "
Then I lose my nerve and I finish with , " go to the bathroom . "
He may think I 'm sick .
I have to tell Rachel , but ....
We just gotta get it over with .
Next time we see them , we 'll just tell them .
That 's it .
That 's how it 'll work now ? You 'll just order me around ?
Pretty much .
All right .
Monica
Hey , man , you feeling better ?
We have something to tell you .
Oh , my God ! You 're pregnant !
No !
No ？ No ！
Look , Joe , here 's the thing .
Monica and I have decided to live together , here . I 'm gonna be moving out , man .
I 'm really happy for you guys . Congratulations . See you later .
Are you okay ?
I gotta go . I 've got an acting job .
Like you 'd believe that .
This sucks !
I 'll be across the hall . And I promise you ...
the minute Monica and I break up , I 'm moving right back in .
Maybe that 's now .
If you 're gonna move in with him ... I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him .
He 's a terrible roommate . Terrible .
He forgets to .... He always , he always ....
Who am I kidding ? He 's the best roommate !
Hey , Phoebe .
Hey .
Oh , look , here 's an article about people who marry people and don 't tell them .
Really ?
Yeah , I 'm reading Ross Geller Magazine .
Have you seen Rachel ?
No , why ?
I have some exciting news .
You 're pregnant .
No ! Chandler and I are moving in together . Oh , that 's good !
But if you were pregnant , what would you name it ? H@@ int , Phoebe .
What 's up ?
Chandler and I are moving in together .
Oh , my God . Oh , my little sister and my best friend ... sha@@ cking up .
That 's great . That 's great .
Guys , I 'm happy too . Okay , come here .
Big day , huh ? People moving in . People getting annu@@ lled .
I gotta go find Rachel .
If you see her , give her some really bad news , so mine doesn 't seem so bad .
Something bad to tell Rachel .
Bad news for Rachel . What could that be ?
Can you just lay off , please ?
My life is an embarrassment . I should just go live under somebody 's stairs .
It 's not that big a deal .
You 'll have been divorced three times . You 'll have a life , you 'll date ..
No , I won 't . I 'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now .
The only guys below me will be Four-@@ Divorce Guy ... Murderer Guy
and geo@@ logists .
Ross , you 're being ridiculous . You are cute and smart and sweet .
That is much more important than three stupid divor@@ ces .
Have you dated anyone who 's been divorced three times ?
That 's not fair . Most guys that have been divorced three times are 60 .
You 're young .
That 's true , I am young .
Well ....
Nobody cares about this except you . This embarrassment thing is all in your head .
Here , I 'll show you .
Come here .
What ?
Hi . My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time . But wouldn 't you date him ?
And if you wait right here , I 'll go get Ross .
I thought you were Rachel . What gave me away ?
I gotta tell her .
I told Ross and Phoebe . She 's the only one left .
It 's official . We 're moving in together . No turning back .
Are you scared ? Are you ? !
I 'm not .
That was my sca@@ riest voice . You 're brave .
The worst day .
You 're finally making progress at work , then your boss calls you Rac@@ quel .
Listen , for the first four years of my work , everybody called me Sha@@ -@@ la-@@ lap
Seriously .
I believe you .
It was in the middle of a meeting , so no one wants to correct her .
So everyone 's calling me Rac@@ quel .
By the end of the day , the mail@@ room guys were calling me Rocky .
Well , I still think you 're very , very nice and very pretty .
What ?
All yours , babe .
Have a seat .
Listen to me , Chandler and I ... are going to live together ... Here .
Oh , my God . That 's so great !
I 'm so happy for you guys !
Really ?
And that was so sweet of you to ask me .
The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together !
Yes , we are .
Chandler , you 'll have to watch those long showers you take ... because you know Rac@@ quel can 't be late .
He 'll work on that .
This is so exciting !
Come and knock on our door
We 'll be waiting for you
Once you know the stories , it 's not that bad .
My first marriage : my wife 's hidden her sexuality . It 's not my fault .
My second marriage : I said the wrong name at the altar . It 's a little my fault .
My third marriage :
They shouldn 't let you get married ... when you 're drunk and have writing on your face . It 's Nevada 's fault .
So what do you think ? Who wouldn 't want to date him ?
The divor@@ ces don 't bother me . I 'd date him . But not while he 's still married .
And you , wouldn 't you want to date ?
I 'm not dating at all anymore .
I was only dating guys that were bad for me .
So I decided that ... Good . Good . Whatever .
And you , Meg ?
Well , I don 't care about the divor@@ ces , either . But I wouldn 't date him .
Normally , he doesn 't sweat this much .
It 's just that he 's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl . What ?
She said , " He 's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl . "
This is crazy . I mean , yes , Rachel is my good friend .
And I have loved her in the past ... but now , she is just my wife .
Phoebe , will you help me out here ?
Well , I thought you loved her when you married her .
We were drunk ! I would 've married Joey with that amount of alcohol .
You could do a lot worse than Joey Tri@@ bbi@@ ani !
I 'm sorry , but you guys are wrong . I just don 't want to be divorced three times .
Now he 's using this three-@@ divor@@ ces reason ... because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .
I must say , well done . Bravo , Meg .
Fine . If this is what you think , forget about ... the whole three-@@ divorce thing .
I 'll go to my lawyer 's office right now and get this marriage annu@@ lled .
She means nothing to me . Nothing !
Okay , now I wouldn 't date you because you seem a little creepy .
I am so attracted to him right now .
When will we tell Rachel what actually will happen ?
Soon . I just couldn 't before . You saw how upset Joey got .
I couldn 't do it . She 's my best friend .
Joey 's my best friend .
I 'm not your best friend ?
You just said ...
Of course you 're my best friend .
Would you tell Rachel ?
All right . At least I 'm prepared .
Oh , yes .
They 're not for you . Are you upset ?
I am now .
Hey , roo@@ mie . Okay , bye .
There 's something important I have to tell you .
Are you pregnant ?
No , but I 'm throwing this shirt away .
I think there was a little misunderstanding before .
When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together ...
we meant alone together .
Oh , my God . That 's funny . I can 't believe I did that .
No , sweetie . You know what ? This is my fault . I wasn 't clear . I 'm really sorry .
Listen , you take as much time as you need to move out , okay ? There 's absolutely no rush .
Okay .
Okay
Don 't you want a cookie ?
Sure .
Thanks . Do you need a tissue ?
Where did you get these ?
I made them .
Oh , My God , they 're so yummy !
Okay , whose is this ?
That 's mine .
And what about this ? Whose is this ?
That 's mine .
Okay , whose dish@@ washing soap is this ?
That was here when we moved in .
Oh , I guess it really is concentrated .
It 's gonna be weird when I come home and you 're not here .
No more Joey and Chan 's . No more J and C 's .
Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler 's ? I can 't . It 's not there .
I 'll be across the hall . We can still do all the same stuff .
We won 't be able to have those long talks at night ... about our feelings and the future .
Not once did we do that .
Don 't you remember that night , it was late and I was feeling sick ...
and you said I would feel better tomorrow ?
Oh , yeah . I remember that .
I don 't know . I 'm just gonna miss living with you . Yeah , me too , man .
What the hell is that ?
That 's disgusting .
I told Rachel that it 's just gonna be the two of us . Oh , yeah ? Well , how 'd she take it ?
Really well . Surpri@@ singly well .
She didn 't cry . She wasn 't angry or sad .
And you 're upset because you didn 't make your best friend cry ?
All I 'm asking for is a little emotion . Is that too much to ask after six years ?
What , are Rachel and I not as close as you guys ? I mean , did we not have as much fun ?
Don 't I deserve a few tears ?
When we told Joey , he cried his eyes out .
I did not cry my eyes out !
Come on , it 's like the end of an era . No more J-@@ Man and Chan@@ ny 's !
Okay , I gotta ask , who calls us that ?
You got married again ?
Yes .
So that 's your second marriage in two years ?
Yes . Second in two years . Third , overall .
I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years ... and never have I had so much business from one client .
Why don 't you tell me what happened ?
Basically , Rachel and I were in Vegas , and we got drunk .
I 'm sorry , is this the same Rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ?
Yes , yes , yes . But I do not love her .
That 's better then .
This was just a drunken mistake , and I need to get it annu@@ lled . I see .
Have you considered therapy ?
I think just the annu@@ l@@ ment for today .
There are some forms to fill out .
It 's easy .
We 'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind .
It 's no problem .
We 'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge .
There 's no way to do this without her ? Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of
Of course you did .
Look , you can 't get an annu@@ l@@ ment unless you and Rachel are both there .
What about someone who looks like Rachel ?
I will think about the therapy .
So I was thinking that maybe we should start divi@@ ding up our stuff .
Okay .
No point in dragging it out .
Dra@@ gging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore .
Okay
What about this ? Who gets this ?
I don 't know if I want it because it might be too many memories .
What is that ?
I don 't know .
How about this ? I want you to have the big plate .
Wow , Monica , thanks . I love this plate .
Something to remember me by .
Mon , you 're not dying . I 'm just moving out .
We 're gonna see each other all the time .
But still , it 's a big change . The end of an era , you might say .
Are you okay ? You 're not blinking .
I 'm fine . I was thinking about how it 's an end of an era .
Oh , all right .
But I gotta say , I don 't think six years counts as an era .
An era is defined as a significant period of time .
It was significant for me . Maybe it wasn 't significant to you !
What is the matter with you ?
What is the matter with you ? !
Why aren 't you more upset ? Aren 't you gonna be sad that we 're not living together ?
Aren 't you gonna miss me at all ?
Monica , all right . But don 't get mad at me .
It 's just a little hard to believe . What 's hard to believe ?
I mean , it 's you guys . You do this kind of stuff , you know ?
You were gonna get married in Vegas , and then you backed out .
I 'm not upset because I don 't see you going through with it . I 'm sorry .
It 's going to happen . Chandler will move in here .
But I ...
I know , just let me finish , okay ?
This isn 't something that we just impul@@ sively decided to do in Vegas . This is something that we both really want .
And it is going to happen . It is ?
Really ? Yeah , sweetie .
You mean , we 're not gonna live together anymore ?
No
Oh , my God . I 'm gonna miss you so much . I 'm gonna miss you .
I mean , it 's the end of an era ! I know !
Okay , bye .
Oh , no .
So did you get the annu@@ l@@ ment ?
I couldn 't .
I knew it . Because you love Rachel .
It 's not that . An@@ nu@@ l@@ ments are more complicated ...
It 's complicated because of the love .
I do not love Rachel .
I 'm telling her about the whole thing ... so we can get this marriage annu@@ lled as fast as possible .
Would I do that if I loved her ?
I 've never been more convinced of your love for her .
I do not have feelings for Rachel , okay ?
Oh , what 's wrong ?
Monica and Chandler are moving in here ... and I have to move out and everything is changing .
Oh , my God , come here , come here . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay .
Thank you .
Of course .
So Ross and Rachel got married . Monica and Chandler almost got married .
You think we should hook up ?
Oh , we do . But not just yet .
Really ? Well , when ?
Well , first Chandler and Monica will get married ... and be filthy rich , by the way .
But it won 't work out .
Wow . I know .
Then I 'll marry Chandler for the money .
And you 'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids . Great .
But then we ditch them and we get married .
We 'll have Chandler 's money and Rachel 's kids .
Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel 's drinking problem .
What about Ross ? I don 't want to go into the whole thing . But
we have words and I kill him .
23 , red and odd .
No !
Yes ! Motherfucker !
Fucking nailed it , T !
23 . Sophia 's birthday . I should have had that .
Got it like five ways there .
Six . He 's on red too .
You cock@@ sucking motherfucker .
What happened ?
Tone hit one straight up .
Finally .
6@@ 6-@@ 1 0 going out .
Don 't spill those .
Take it or play it ?
Let us play it .
All right .
All right , my man .
23 and all around .
You kidding ?
You gotta ride that .
One more time .
Come on .
Do it again !
Come on .
23 .
Come on , come on .
Come on , bounce .
Do it again !
Come on , 23 .
11 .
Fucking Christ .
Jeez .
Dou@@ che@@ bags are taking it all back tonight .
What the fuck , Vito ? You almost hit me .
Ti@@ mber , motherfucker .
Stop right there !
Ten to one odds . Poor Boy 's De@@ light and she fucking comes in .
Oh !
Look at this me@@ zz@@ a-@@ mor@@ t .
Hey .
Sil .
How are you , baby ?
Good to see you .
Hey .
Sit down .
Can I get you something ? A coffee or a bun ?
I 'll let you two talk .
So ?
I really appreciate you letting me see you .
And you 've been so decent about everything since Vito 's death .
I just don 't know who else ...
All right , all right . Come on , Marie .
What can I do ?
It 's Little V .
The social worker says he 's just acting out .
Social worker ?
Boy stuff mostly ,
but he is so angry .
Although some of what he 's being accused of is just persecu@@ tion .
They claim that he hung the Pe@@ tru@@ zz@@ os ' cat on their garage door ,
but it 's totally un@@ founded .
Well , you know , in a way it 's to be expected , with Vito passing and all that that en@@ tra@@ iled .
I think the only solution is to move away
from that house and the kids at school .
I figured it out ,
and I know it 's a lot ,
but for 100,000 ,
we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened .
My friend Cheryl lives in O@@ ron@@ o , Maine , by the university .
by the university .
And there 's this two-@@ stor@@ ey cape ,
with solid schools .
You always said if there 's anything you could do ...
Sure .
Have you talked to his uncle ?
Who ?
Phil .
Phil 's not his uncle . Him and I are second cousins .
Before we get too drastic here
and up@@ root little Vito and all of you
from your friends and your family ,
I should talk to him . He 's impossible to talk to .
It 's not easy to substitute for a dad .
I know .
But maybe I can fill in here .
OK , but you 'll think about it ?
Believe me , I 'm gonna take care of you and he 's gonna be OK .
Well ,
apparently Vito Junior 's a whack job .
No surprise there . Family history ?
She wants 100@@ K for a change of scenery .
That never works .
She should get him a dog .
I don 't think that 's a good idea .
The point is , how the fuck is this my problem ?
Because I 'm the boss of the family ?
Where the fuck is Phil Leo@@ tar@@ do ?
He created the situation by cli@@ pping Vito to begin with .
My best fucking ear@@ ner .
Now second time around I 'm getting my pocket picked .
Not to mention he 's his uncle
or cousin or whatever the fuck .
Not your problem . I agree .
I agree , Jim .
I argued against the on-@@ side kick .
Let us face it , they rarely work .
The over@@ worked Bu@@ cs D are falling apart
as the Bi@@ lls ,
with that play , are inside the 30 and loaded for goal .
Let us go . Come on .
Just watch .
Bi@@ lls will get another seven .
You think ?
Nah , I say a quick field goal wins it .
Absolutely .
They 'll choke . That 's what they do . You got Buffalo , right , T ?
Line is three . I 'll settle for a push .
Buffalo ! Fucking go for it !
Third and two , the snap . Lo@@ sman 's back , he hands it off .
Fu@@ mble !
Ball 's ... Buffalo re@@ covers .
No !
Fu@@ mble again .
Get him ! Come on !
Oh , no . Oh , boy . Get him !
Buffalo scores as time expi@@ res .
Un@@ -@@ fucking-@@ believable .
Buffalo ! Fucking A !
Listen to this fucking guy . Probably won $ 35 down there .
Final score , Buffalo 28 ,
Ta@@ mpa Bay 24 .
Skip , another beer ?
No , I 'm gonna go take a snoo@@ ze .
Beautiful , sweetheart .
Nancy Sinatra , everybody .
Congratulations , Philly .
Thank you .
We were gonna go the festival route
but we found a guy who wants to distribute it himself ,
so we 'll see .
It 's a good little movie .
Jesus Christ , it 's 11 : 30 .
Ready to call it ?
An hour ago .
I saw him bring Dean and Jerry back together .
I was there at the tele@@ thon .
I cried .
You leaving already ?
Yeah , it 's late .
Got a long hike to Jersey from here .
Sure , I used to drive it myself .
No more , though .
I 'll be right back .
Congratulations again .
Listen , I gotta bring this up .
A favour already ?
Excuse me ?
Anthony , you always have business on your mind .
Take a night , smell the cognac .
Marie Spa@@ ta@@ fore came to see me .
She wants 100 grand to re@@ locate
on account of Vito Junior already has his own social worker .
Patty told me there was do@@ ings .
The turd doesn 't fall far from the faggot 's ass .
That 's beautifully put ,
but you 're family , right ? Cou@@ sins ?
What can you do ? Throw money at the problem ?
Well , somebody 's gonna .
I 'll talk to the kid , set him right .
Good .
You two going home together ?
How the fuck are you ?
Fucking prostate keep me pissing all night .
I wouldn 't wish it on my worst enemy .
A drink ?
I talked to Phil about the split on the MR@@ l cent@@ res .
Your cut is on the way .
So is Christmas .
You should have heard him tonight .
Com@@ ments , smug .
Really ?
Wor@@ ries me .
I thought we were getting along pretty good finally ,
you know , considering .
Could be the hu@@ bris , making boss .
I think it 's what went down with his brother Billy .
I thought all that got buried with your cousin .
You enjoy the dinner ?
I left right after .
Yeah ?
I don 't know .
I look at my key guys ,
Paulie , Christopher , my brother-in-law ,
what 's number one on their agenda ?
They 're all fucking murderers , for Christ 's sake .
Lonely at the top , boy@@ chi@@ k ?
What I 'm trying to say is ...
it 's nice being here .
Always is .
Oh .
I brought you something .
Cover up that dome .
Actually , I was expecting something else .
What , the fucking DVD ?
It 's a very un@@ flattering portrait
of l@@ tali@@ an-@@ Americans .
No , I was thinking maybe some of that 200,000 I loaned you ?
Oh , Jesus . Yeah , that 's right .
I know it 's covered . It 's just after a while ...
You know , I lost track .
I 'm glad you didn 't .
I don 't wanna be a stick@@ ler .
No .
Anthony , come on . No , it 's OK . It 's OK .
I got about three grand here . Point and a half good ?
No , come on , fuck this .
You gotta have it .
I don 't want you eating cat food .
Stop it .
I don 't gotta have it . I don 't want a vi@@ g from you .
No , come on .
I should have been on it .
You sure ?
Jesus Christ , are we good or what ?
Well , it 's late .
I should be getting back .
You should get back to pissing , or whatever you ...
I lend the guy money . Suddenly I 'm the schmuck .
Why does he need your money ?
Why ? To cover his nut .
Between his gambling and the lifestyle
and that boat ...
3.@@ 2 mil . I warned him .
It has absolutely no re@@ sale value whatsoever .
Does he listen ?
I 've lent lots of money .
Once the chi@@ selling starts , " I forgot . "
Who forgets ? Fuck him .
This is why I don 't like you seeing him before bed . You 're all upset .
Makes a big show of giving me a vi@@ g .
3,000 a week .
You got a lot of Jews in your business , right ?
My business ?
Yeah , this .
You gotta hand it to them , when it comes to money ...
In my experience ,
that 's nothing more than an ugly stereo@@ type . Really ?
I got a friend , you tie a Kru@@ ger@@ rand to a fishing line , you 're gonna land him .
Right up on the dock by him .
Doesn 't sound like you think of him as a friend .
Come on . We go way back .
But that didn 't stop him from busting my balls cos I owe him some money .
Anyway , I needed a little bridge loan
to cover some of my gambling losses .
Still ?
You know , good money after bad .
Why not just stop ?
Big part of my life .
You 've been talking about it a lot .
Well , you lose sometimes .
You gotta act like it hurts a little more than it does , for your guys .
But if you 're gonna lose , what 's the fucking point ?
So you need the risk .
What are you chasing ?
Money or a high from winning ?
Before we end ,
there 's something I need to bring up .
You miss a lot of appointments .
I always give you the required notice or I pay for the hour .
That 's not my point .
Well , I get busy .
It 's my fault . I 've con@@ doned it for a long time .
I haven 't had a panic attack since my uncle shot me .
Did you notice that ?
Yes .
Well , it must be nice to know everything .
Is that the only reason why you 're here ?
The panic attacks ?
No .
This is
an ... o@@ asis in my week .
So this is vacation ?
No , I benefit in many ways .
De@@ cide if you wanna keep coming ,
but you know there are protocols that you have to be followed
or I won 't be able to continue .
OK , I will .
Now , I know Brian wants the media room downstairs ,
but I think it 's better if the gym has access to the pool .
That 's the inspector .
I told the guy to run cable for computers
but I can 't promise it 's not already obsolete .
Hi . How are you ? Ted Y@@ ac@@ ane@@ lli , Y@@ ac@@ ane@@ lli Home ln@@ spe@@ ctions .
Come in . These are our cousins , Hugh and Carmela .
They 're also the buil@@ ders .
Great .
Do you wanna start over here ?
Yeah .
I didn 't come out here just to buy you a couple of sun@@ da@@ es .
It 's a Sil@@ o .
I don 't give a fuck what it is .
What the hell 's wrong with you ?
You look like a Puerto Ri@@ can whore . You make me sick .
So ? What 's it gotta do with you ?
Listen , p@@ ally , you need to be rebelli@@ ous .
I raised kids . I get it .
Good for you .
You want a smack too ?
You ever think what this is doing to your mother ,
what she 's been through , how you 're upsetting her ?
She 's just embarrassed .
She cries for you .
I 'm gonna say this cos you 're old enough to understand .
Your family 's had enough shame .
You should set things right .
You understand me ?
No .
Jesus Christ . Be a man .
Be the kind of man she needs , strong , masculine .
I said my piece .
Finish that thing . There 's no eating in the car .
I 'd like to take a minute for everybody to enjoy the fact
that your mother has sold her house .
Oh , my God , that 's fantastic .
Congratulations , Mom .
That 's so good .
It just passed inspection .
Brian needs to get loan approval ...
All right , enough .
Congratulations , Carm . It 's not an easy thing to do these days .
I had a lot of support .
Brian and Janine must be so happy .
I hope so .
Just the two ? It 's big , right ?
It 's a mansion .
Pass me the salad .
They have a baby on the way .
Hello ?
Have you looked outside ?
Oh , Jesus , Mel@@ lie .
We replaced 60 ... 50 % of the bad lu@@ mber with Doug fi@@ r .
What about the stu@@ ds ?
And those hea@@ ders upstairs ? I 'm nauseous .
For the hundre@@ dth time ,
I 've done a ton of houses using the same construction before these so@@ b sisters took over the building department
and I 'm not losing any sleep .
Lunch .
Mor@@ ta@@ della and pro@@ vol@@ one .
That 's Chrissy .
The mysterious stranger .
Hey .
Long time .
Sit . I had to drop Eli off at physical therapy .
I thought I 'd check in on the brain trust .
Play a hand .
Yeah , don 't be shy , Sh@@ y@@ lock .
I got a little time . Why not ?
" Why not ? " he says .
Did you hear the one about the Jewish terrorist ?
He was gonna hijack a plane but he didn 't wanna use his miles .
You want a sandwich ?
I just ate , thanks .
He 's not here to eat .
He 's here for the rent . The rent , the rent .
What are you talking about ?
You know what ? I 'll have a beer .
Here you go .
Will you stop already ?
That should get me through another week .
I got some spare change here too .
It 's a joke .
Where 's your sense of humour ?
Put this in the pot , make things interesting .
I 'll take a shot at that .
Let us play .
Let us see it .
Are you sure you did it right ?
Yes , and it 's normal . Maybe it was the Kung Pao .
Get me a drink .
Sure , alcohol , that 's good for it .
Get one yourself .
It 's not the fucking M@@ S@@ G . It 's Tony Soprano .
You know , he really helped me when I was in the hospital .
Never lend friends money , Eli .
He still won 't pay ?
That 's the least of it .
He 's all worked up or something .
I don 't like the way he talks . Ho@@ stile remarks .
It 's not like him . Makes me worry .
Yeah , I can see that . What are you thinking ?
Come on .
Tony 's not gonna hurt you .
You 've seen how these l@@ ta@@ lians work .
For the most part , it 's OK .
Get them cornered , you 're dealing with nothing more than an animal .
You think he 's gonna kill you now ?
I don 't fucking know .
He 's the guy I call to deal with people like him .
He 's a rich man . He 'll pay .
His minus assets ?
I 'd say under six .
He 's a boss .
I 've known him a long time .
Money goes in one hand and out the other .
The more he makes , the more he spends .
His wife ?
At what point is it cheaper for him to settle it another way ?
Yeah , right . Time to go .
Hello , Mr Chi@@ ps .
Yeah , we 're up about ...
18 .
I could go for a ri@@ b-@@ eye .
No kidding . What , because I 'm up ?
Holy shit .
What ?
Ba@@ ta@@ via in the fifth . Two to one .
Meadow Gold in the fifth .
We gotta do that .
Three minutes to post .
Glen@@ li@@ vet rocks .
Seven and seven .
What do you have on tap ?
Give him a beer , anything .
Fuck it , I don 't wanna miss this .
Ba@@ ta@@ via , here we go . Where 's the goddamn sound ? The boss put 1 8-@@ plus on this .
Maybe 25 .
Yeah ?
What the fuck 's your problem ?
Nothing . I 'm excited . What do you want ?
They 're running .
Where 's the fucking sound ?
It 's on , Tone .
Go , girl !
Go , you fucking nag . There you go .
Come on , baby .
She 's in the lead !
She 's in the lead , come on .
Come on , go , girl !
Go , go , go ! That a girl ! Go , go , go !
R@@ ounding the turn , Swe@@ lli@@ g@@ ant , Meadow Gold , M@@ esti@@ zo .
K@@ ir Ro@@ yale and Smoo@@ sh Baby falling back .
It 's Swe@@ lli@@ g@@ ant and Meadow Gold .
Come on !
K@@ ir Ro@@ yale on the outside .
Swe@@ lli@@ g@@ ant and Meadow Gold .
Fucking go !
And it 's Swe@@ lli@@ g@@ ant by a nose .
By a cunt hair , Tony .
Heart@@ breaker .
What are you gonna do ?
Madam , your dessert .
I didn 't order nothing .
I ordered for you .
You know I 'm trying to watch my weight .
What is this ?
Oh , my God . Anthony .
You like it ?
It 's gorgeous .
I don 't know what to say .
Look , I know you 're scared , OK ?
All the problems you had with Hector 's dad ... I 'm not like that .
I know . It 's not just that .
Well , what , then ? I 'm gonna work my ass off .
You know I 'll always take care of you guys .
In three months I made night manager of the pizz@@ eria .
In another three I 'll be in charge of the day shifts .
A couple of years , I 'll own a chain of restaurants , clubs .
You 'll never have to work again .
Look , I love you .
I love you too .
So marry me , then . And we 'll have kids .
You always say you want Hector to have brothers and sisters .
OK .
Can I get you some coffee ?
No , I think it 's time for our talk here .
So what happened at school today ?
I get blamed for everything .
The girl was develop@@ mentally disabled .
Uncle Phil said he talked to you .
Is he just wasting his breath ?
Is that what you 're telling us ?
This trouble you 're causing ,
I 'm disappointed cos you always were a good kid .
You don 't even know me .
What is that supposed to mean ?
Sometimes you call me Carlo Jr .
I couldn 't shut your dad up about what a good kid you were .
We were friends , you know .
Butt buddies ?
You 're being funny .
That 's good .
Cos I 'm sure you miss him a lot ,
whatever he was .
And now I wanna say some things .
You 're gonna look at me .
I 'm not moving to fucking Maine !
You think anybody wants that ? You know how much that 's gonna cost your mother ?
Whatever .
Listen to me , OK ?
I 'm not some fucking social worker .
You knock this weird shit off
or I 'll introduce you to a pla@@ te-@@ glass window .
Somebody should have told my dad to knock off the weird shit .
You go about in pity for yourself .
What about what your mother 's been through ?
What am I supposed to do about it ?
Your dad 's gone . You 're the man of the house .
Start fucking acting like it .
You get me ?
Well , I just got back from the closing .
Come here !
We should pop the champagne or go out or something .
Maybe . I don 't know .
Why not ?
You know why not , Tony .
It 's upsetting , this whole thing .
Jesus , the lu@@ mber again ?
Carm , your cousin Brian has fucked over a lot of people .
Trust me .
So how much in the end ? All in ?
Well , after construction ,
the purchase of the land , closing costs ,
it must be close to six .
Yeah .
You know what you should do ?
Take a chunk of that and put it on the Je@@ ts .
Yes , very funny .
I 'm serious . We can 't get hurt .
It 's " we " now ?
It 's a sure thing . Celia , she works at the Bing ,
she 's got a sister lives in San Diego ,
she 's an o@@ ste@@ op@@ ath , and she says that the Char@@ gers ' Q@@ B
has a hair@@ line fracture in his right leg .
And even Vegas doesn 't know about it .
I didn 't say all of it .
You know , just a piece of my half .
You 're rich , Tony . Use some of those bun@@ dles to cover it .
That money 's for emergencies only , Carm .
My other money 's tied up in asset al@@ location .
What is that ?
Listen to me , OK ? This is the gravy .
Wind@@ fall cash .
This is the kind of shit you play with .
I 'm telling you , we are golden here .
Listen .
Forget it .
I shouldn 't have mentioned it .
I mean it .
It 's all right , it 's just I thought this was my money .
You 're right . You 're right .
It ’ s yours .
Ren@@ ata ?
What ?
Go to the bedroom and lock the door .
What 's going on ?
Do as I ask .
What are you doing here ?
Nice to see you too .
I was watching CNN . Fucking He@@ z@@ bo@@ llah .
We 're running down to the boat show in Edison .
Thought you might want to join .
I 'd love to .
But Ren@@ ata 's got a migraine .
That 's too bad .
The vi@@ g . Three gran@@ ds . Should put us up to date .
I can 't take this . Give it all to me whenever you can .
You 're gonna do this every time ?
Whatever you say .
Sit down . Have a drink .
We should get going , probably .
OK . But next time .
For sure ?
Yeah , next time I 'll call first .
Did you see that pis@@ sy attitude ?
Come all the way out here to pick him up ,
not to mention give him his fucking vi@@ g in person .
You believe this fucking guy ?
Should tell him to go fuck himself for his 200@@ K .
What 's he gonna do about it ?
To not pay my debts ? Head of the family ?
How 's that gonna look ?
Who 's gonna know ?
It 's like Eddie Valentine .
That guy from Philly ?
With the poli@@ o leg and the buil@@ t-up shoe ?
No , from the Twilight Zone .
You must have seen that one .
You should start sucking cock instead of watching TV Land
cos Vito brought in three times what you do on construction .
Yeah .
And I didn 't have this fucking problem .
God fucking damn it !
What ?
That 's good , right ?
No . I only bet ten .
But you won .
What did I say ?
What did I tell you ? It 's a sure thing .
You talk about this crap like it 's science .
I lost a lot of fucking money .
You didn 't lose .
We could have turned your bullshit into a million dollars .
My " bullshit " ?
That spe@@ c house was my investment .
For my future !
Here we go .
Ginny Sack had to move in with her daughter .
Again with Ginny Sack .
John provided . She 's a fucking hysteri@@ c .
Did you ever think I might know what I 'm doing ?
You and the furniture and the cars .
You would have spent everything I made if I let you .
The next time you win I 'll take a cut ,
and I 'll roll the fucking dice .
You already took your cut , from the bird fee@@ der .
And don 't fucking deny it again .
What ? 40 grand in the stock market ?
I 'd ask for my piece , but there 's nothing .
That spe@@ c house ? I made the down payment .
I bought the materials .
I leaned on that building inspector when you had your thumb up your ass .
So stop talking about your money !
Let go of me , you piece of shit !
You 're a shitty business@@ woman who built a pie@@ ce-@@ of-@@ shit house
that 's gonna cave in and kill that fucking unborn baby any day .
And now you can 't sleep .
Go fuck yourself !
When I 'm gone you can live in a dumpster for all I care .
I was so ... I told you , dude .
At three-@@ point range the ball wouldn 't hit the rim .
That was the worst pass .
Get lost .
Nobody drop the soap . Spa@@ z@@ -a-@@ fuck@@ wit 's in the house .
You can see his pussy .
What the fuck you looking at , fag ?
What the fuck ?
He shit .
Oh , God !
Jesus , what 's wrong with you ?
He stepped in it !
Gross !
He shit in the fucking shower !
Are you crazy ?
Cock@@ sucker 's Cor@@ va@@ ir Mon@@ za is still in his garage ,
so we boost the piece of shit .
We 're heading down Communi@@ paw Avenue
and the fucking thing starts ...
You get word on the power tools ?
What ? Yeah . S@@ pics in Florida sending the first truck Friday .
How about the hardware store ?
Ready for the whole load .
Speaking of loads , hear about Vito Junior ?
What ?
Marie called . He got expelled cos he took a shit in the shower in gym class .
That sick little fuck .
You should see him .
The make-up .
And without school , Marie says he 's shut in his room all day .
Probably thinking about how to pull a Columb@@ ine .
But the little girl ...
Francesca .
Her dad 's gone , her brother 's a psycho ,
her mother 's a basket case . She 's nine years old .
What the fuck did she ever do ?
Tra@@ ge@@ dy .
Like a pe@@ bble in a lake . Even the fish feel it .
It 's not right .
Vito was one of us .
So he sucked a cock . Prior to that , he was our friend .
Can 't just cut his family loose .
That piece of shit , Phil , he 's never gonna pony up .
I tell you what , I will never forget that he didn 't come through here .
Never .
Let it go , Tone .
This is good of you , Tone , helping Marie .
I 'll always remember it .
Let us go . I gotta swing by Sla@@ va 's ,
liqu@@ ef@@ y some offshore mon@@ ies .
Yeah , dude .
Yeah .
Hey , Jesus , you got outta work early .
I need to talk to you .
What 's the matter ?
What 's this ?
Your clothes .
I just did laundry a couple days ago .
It 's not laundry .
Ma@@ mi !
No , Papi , stay .
What about the parade ?
I 'm going with my brother .
What ?
I need to give this back to you .
I can 't keep it .
Why ? I mean , I love you .
I love you , too , Anthony .
Look , I don 't know . Maybe I don 't .
All 's I know is I just don 't feel it .
You hear about this thing with the Dol@@ phins ' kicker ?
He went under a whole truck .
Yeah , fucking motor@@ cycles .
Hel@@ met saved his life .
He out for Sunday ?
Maybe the whole season .
And the backup kicker ? He 's right out of college .
Against Philly .
Too good to be true .
I 'm gonna put the whole 100@@ K down on Philadelphia .
And if I win , Marie Spa@@ ta@@ fore gets a free ride and then some .
Yeah , good for you .
Cos Carlo said the kid went into the litter box and ate some cat shit .
No , he took a shit , in the shower .
Glad we got that straight .
Hell of a finish .
In@@ ju@@ ries , even tragedy , they are unable to stop Miami .
Final score , Miami 21 , Philadelphia 7 .
When you get support like that ,
it makes all the difference .
Hey , Marie . How you holding up ?
He snuck out again last night .
Like I told you , I want to help you .
God bless you , Tony . I don 't know what else to do .
Well , I do .
There 's this camp in l@@ da@@ ho and they handle kids like him .
I@@ da@@ ho ?
You know , like tough love ? You know ?
Saw it on TV ,
and honestly , I was moved to tears by some of the success stories .
It 's a camp ?
A school camp .
Tony .
They allow corporal punishment .
His guidance coun@@ se@@ llor told me about those places ,
and they 're in Utah and l@@ da@@ ho
because state law allows them to strike the kids .
That 's just for the deter@@ rent factor .
It 's 18 grand but I 'm gonna take care of it for you ,
so don 't worry .
There 's no geo@@ graphi@@ cal solution to an emotional problem , Marie .
Maine , wherever .
Marie ?
Yeah ?
I know it 's hard ,
but it 's the best thing for him .
OK ?
Thank you , Tony .
Hey , Tone , isn 't that ...
What 's their names ? Used to hang out at the Bing .
Wake up , Vito .
What ?
Vito , my name is Steve . I 'm here to help you .
You 're gonna come with us now , all right ?
Come on .
What ?
Come on .
No , let me go !
Come on . Hey !
It 's all right .
Let me go ! Mom , no !
It 's gonna be OK .
I 'm so sorry , honey .
Stop . Let me go !
It 'll be OK .
You have to be strong . You 're doing the right thing .
Who are you ?
Franny , go back to bed .
Mrs Spa@@ ta@@ fore , he 's gonna be fine .
Mom !
I 'm sorry , honey .
No ! No .
Oh , God .
This one coming down to the buzzer .
St@@ ack@@ house dra@@ ining a three-@@ poin@@ ter as time ran out ,
I@@ ea@@ ding Dallas to a 10@@ 9 to 10@@ 8 victory over the visiting San Antonio Sp@@ urs .
So what ? We 're not speaking now ?
Listen to me , come here .
What ?
Sit down .
Come on .
I 'm sorry .
I really am .
You did real good with that house .
And I should know . I 'm in construction .
I 'm glad to hear you approve .
I have been losing .
I 'm fucking losing right now .
A real shitty streak .
So your solution is to risk more and make things even worse ?
You start chasing it .
And every time you get your hands around it
you fall further backwards
So this is about money ? Cos it didn 't feel like it .
Carm , I swear to you , you 're not gonna be like Ginny .
I 've been real good about that
and it 's not gonna happen to us .
I hate that you 're going around acting all the time like it will .
I worry , Tony . I do .
You already got shot .
Now you won 't go down and get the paper . Who is out there ?
Come on ...
What is it ?
What are the million other possibilities ?
The F@@ B@@ l waiting to take you away ?
You eat and you play ,
and you pretend there 's not a giant piano hanging by a rope over the top of your head every minute of every day .
That 's it . I 've been thinking about this .
Now , I survived a fucking gunshot wound .
What are the odds on that ?
Terrible .
So if you think about it ,
I 'm up .
What ?
Way up .
That was me , not a fire@@ boat .
10 : 30 .
10 : 30 . What would you like for breakfast ?
Ren@@ ata ?
Ren@@ ata ?
Oh , God , no .
Wait . Wait . Ren@@ ata .
Ren@@ ata .
Ren@@ ata
911 . What is the emergency ?
She was a great girl .
Thanks .
The best .
I ...
I brought your money .
Sorry for your loss .
