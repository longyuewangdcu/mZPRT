The large-scale complexity , high-speed growth , diversity of forms , and low value density of big data have brought severe challenges to big data computing .
On the one hand , the complexity and rapid growth of big data have caused many big data computing tasks to require massive computing and analysis technologies .
On the other hand , the form diversity and low value density of big data have caused many big data computing tasks to highly rely on complex cognitive in@@ ference technology , which is still difficult to handle effectively by using current computing technology and algorithms alone .
In response to the needs of complex cogni@@ tion and massive computing for big data tasks , the applicant proposed human-@@ computer collaboration group computing to solve this problem . The group computing model of human-@@ computer collaboration , qual@@ ity-@@ aware group computing methods , and resource controll@@ able In-@@ depth research on group computer science and other aspects has been carried out , and a number of innovative results have been achieved .
Over 100 academic articles have been published on A-@@ Class journals and at conferences of the China Computer Federation and there have been papers published at the three major conferences of SIG@@ MO@@ D , V@@ L@@ DB and IC@@ DE every year .
