Speech at a Symposium on Res@@ ol@@ ving Pro@@ minent Problems in Poverty Alle@@ viation
Xi Jinping
16 April 2019
Today , we are holding an inter@@ provincial symposium on the fight against poverty .
This is the sixth such meeting that I have presided over since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012 .
Before this , I presided over symposi@@ ums on the same subject in Yan ’ an , Gu@@ i@@ yang , Y@@ in@@ ch@@ uan , Tai@@ yuan , and Chengdu , and our fight against poverty has obtained remarkable results .
This symposium is being held in consideration of the fact that we have less than two years left to reach our poverty alleviation objectives , with the year 2019 being particularly crucial .
If we perform our tasks effectively this year , we will be able to lay solid foundations for bringing our poverty alleviation initiatives to a satisfactory conclusion next year .
After getting off the plane at noon yesterday , I first went to Sh@@ iz@@ hu Tu@@ j@@ ia Autonomous County where I visited Zhong@@ yi Township Primary School as well as poor households and veteran CPC members in Hu@@ ax@@ i Village . In the process , I had discussions with village representatives , local officials , poverty alleviation officials , and rural doctors . Through these discussions , I gained an up@@ -@@ close and personal understanding of the progress of poverty alleviation work in Chongqing and efforts that have been made to resolve the prominent problems in assuring the rural poor population that their food and clothing needs will be met and guaranteeing that they have access to compulsory education , basic medical services , and safe housing ( referred to below as the " two assurances and three guarantees " ) , and I now feel at ease about the state of poverty alleviation in Chongqing .
The tasks of this meeting are to analyze the current state of poverty alleviation efforts and to study and resolve outstanding problems relating to the " two assurances and three guarantees . "
Atten@@ ding the symposium are provin@@ ci@@ al-level Party committee secret@@ aries from Guangxi , Chongqing , Sichuan , Gu@@ izhou , Yunnan , Sha@@ anxi , G@@ ans@@ u , and Xinjiang , local representatives of counties , townships , and villages within Chongqing , and officials of relevant central government departments .
Those of you who have spoken just now have presented situations in your respective places , analyzed problems , and put forward ideas and proposals . This is very good . I would now like to add a few suggestions of my own .
I. We must have an accurate grasp of the state of poverty alleviation efforts .
Since the 18th National Congress , the CPC Central Committee has made eradicating poverty the basic mission and symbolic benchmark of our efforts to build a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects , and put forward a series of major plans in this regard .
After the 19th National Congress in 2017 , the Central Committee designated eliminating poverty in a targeted manner as one of the three critical battles for building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
In recent years , our poverty eradication efforts have reached unprecedented levels in terms of their intensity , scale , and impact , and we have made progress in line with anticipated targets .
In November 2015 , at the Central Conference on Poverty Alle@@ viation and Development , we made it clear that by 2020 , we must " ensure that all rural residents falling below China ’ s current poverty line are lifted out of poverty , that all poor counties leave poverty behind , and that regional poverty is eliminated on the whole . "
At that meeting , I said that poverty alleviation should focus on four issues – who exactly needs help , who should implement poverty alleviation initiatives , how poverty alleviation should be carried out , and what standards and procedures should be adopted for ex@@ iting poverty .
As it stands , it seems that these issues have been resolved quite effectively .
To identify who exactly needs help , we have remained committed to alleviating and eradicating poverty in a targeted manner . We have carried out poverty screening at the level of individual villages and individual households , and registered cases of poverty identified through this process . We have also consistently made screening more accurate by adjusting our methods and criteria and by conducting follow-up examinations .
To identify who should implement poverty alleviation initiatives , we have selected more than three million officials from government departments at or above the county level and from state-owned enterprises and government-@@ affiliated institutions to serve as vill@@ age-@@ stationed providers of support . Currently , there are 20@@ 6,000 first secret@@ aries of CPC village committees and 7@@ 00,000 vill@@ age-@@ stationed officials , in addition to 1,9@@ 74@@ ,000 town@@ -@@ level poverty alleviation officials and millions of village officials . We have thus significantly bol@@ ste@@ red our forces on the front lines of poverty alleviation , and ensured that our efforts in this regard overcome final key hur@@ dles .
To identify how poverty alleviation should be carried out , we have put forward five key measures to lift people out of poverty : some by increasing production ; some through relocation ; some through ecological compensation ; some through education ; and some by providing allowances to assist them in meeting their basic needs . We have also allevi@@ ated poverty by boosting employment , improving medical services , and helping people earn returns on assets , etc . Overall , we have tailored initiatives to the needs of different localities and individuals , providing people with what they are missing and allowing them to do what they are capable of doing , thus alleviating poverty by getting to the root of the problem .
To identify standards and procedures for ex@@ iting poverty , I mentioned four points at the meeting in 2015 : setting a timetable , giving a grace period , evaluating the results of our work against strict criteria , and identifying ex@@ its from poverty on a per-@@ household basis .
We have clearly defined the standards and procedures for poor counties , villages , and people to exit poverty , guided localities in ration@@ ally formulating rolling programs and annual plans for poverty alleviation , and organized strict third-party assessments of poor counties that are prepared to exit poverty , with relevant policies remaining stable .
According to feedback from various sources , concrete results have been secured in counties that have declared their exit from poverty .
Generally speaking , we have achieved clear results in our fight against poverty .
First , we have promoted ex@@ its from poverty in an orderly manner . The number of rural residents living below the current poverty line decreased from 9@@ 8.@@ 99 million in 2012 to 16@@ .6 million in 2018 , a total reduction of 8@@ 2.@@ 39 million . An average of more than ten million people have been lifted out of poverty each year for six years running , and poverty rate has dropped from 10.@@ 2 % to 1.7 % . We have changed the former trend toward a year-@@ on-@@ year decrease in the number of people being lifted out of poverty after adopting new standards for ex@@ iting poverty , and broken the bottlen@@ eck that existed in the past two rounds of poverty alleviation in which we were unable to further reduce the poor population when it dropped to about 30 million .
Among the country ’ s 8@@ 32 poor counties , 153 have declared that they have left poverty behind , and 284 are undergoing relevant evaluation . The number of poor counties , which used to increase despite our poverty alleviation efforts , is now decreasing .
It is estimated that after fulfilling this year ’ s task of lifting ten million people and 330 counties out of poverty , there will be only six million poor people and 60-@@ plus poor counties across the country at the beginning of 2020 .
Second , we have achieved overall success with regard to the " two assurances . "
We have ensured that essentially all of our poor citizens have adequate food and clothing , and that people in most areas have access to roads , drinking water , electricity , communication , education , medical services , and safe housing .
Third , construction tasks in alleviating poverty through relocation are ne@@ aring completion .
During the 13th Five-@@ Year Plan period ( 2016-@@ 2020 ) , we planned to relocate about ten million people registered as living in poverty from in@@ hosp@@ itable areas . By the end of last year , construction tasks related to the relocation of 8.7 million people had been completed , and most relocated people have been lifted out of poverty . We expect that the remaining construction tasks will be fully completed this year .
Fourth , the CPC ’ s governing foundations in rural areas have been further consolidated .
A large number of officials have been tem@@ pered in the fight against poverty , local CPC organizations in rural areas have seen their co@@ hesi@@ veness and effectiveness significantly enhanced , rural governance and management capacity at the local level has improved markedly , and the relationship between the Party and the public and between officials and the public has continued to improve .
The success and experience that we have gained in poverty alleviation have contributed Chinese wisdom and solutions to the cause of global poverty reduction , demonstrating the political strength of the CPC ’ s leadership and China ’ s socialist system and winning praise from the international community . Many countries and international organizations have expressed their hope to benefit from China ’ s experience in poverty reduction .
China is the only developing country that has simultaneously brought about rapid development and large-scale poverty reduction and enabled the poor population to share the fruits of reform and development . This is a mirac@@ ulous achievement .
While acknowledging our achievements , we must also be clearly aware of the difficulties and problems that we face as we push toward an overall victory in the fight against poverty . These fall into three main categories .
The first includes problems that directly impact our efforts to realize our objectives in fighting poverty .
For example , there are regions failing to accurately apply poverty alleviation standards . Some have lowered standards and claimed that they have ex@@ ited poverty without seeing that the " two assurances and three guarantees " are fully in place . Even more have raised standards by pursuing free medical services , free education , or relocation with excessive living space . Such actions are not sustainable since they give no consideration to our national conditions .
Another problem is that deeply impoverished areas are still facing daunting poverty alleviation tasks . There are still 1.@@ 72 million people registered as living in poverty in the " three regions " ( Tibet , the four prefec@@ tures of Ho@@ tan , Ak@@ su , Kash@@ gar , and K@@ iz@@ il@@ su in southern Xinjiang , and the ethnic Tibetan areas in Sichuan , Yunnan , G@@ ans@@ u , and Qing@@ hai ) and the " three prefec@@ tures " ( Li@@ ang@@ shan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan , Nu@@ jiang Lis@@ u Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan , and Lin@@ xia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in G@@ ans@@ u ) . With a poverty rate of 8.2 % , these areas make up 12.@@ 5 % of the country ’ s poor population .
There are still 98 counties across the country where the poverty rate is above 10 % . In these counties , there are 3.@@ 5@@ 96 million people registered as living in poverty , accounting for 26 % of the country ’ s poor population , and the poverty rate is 13@@ .3 percentage points higher than the national rate . These areas represent the most stub@@ born challenge in our fight against poverty .
Furthermore , we have yet to secure the " three guarantees , " since weak links still exist in guaranteeing access to compulsory education , basic medical services , safe housing , and safe drinking water . At present , issues covered in the " three guarantees " have yet to be resolved for 14 % of the country ’ s poor population .
Finally , we have seen efforts sl@@ ack@@ en after ex@@ its from poverty , with some counties aband@@ oning poverty alleviation projects , sh@@ ir@@ king their responsibilities , or choosing to take a break , while others have wasted energy and resources on celebrations instead of building on their achievements .
The second includes further improvements that need to be made to our work .
For example , numerous problems have emerged in poverty alleviation such as failure to assume responsibilities , implement policies , and carry out initiatives , going through formalities for form@@ ality sake and bureaucratic practices , deception and manipulation of figures , and mis@@ appropriation of poverty alleviation funds .
The third includes problems that need to be resolved gradually over the long term .
For example , the foundations for industrial development are weak , follow-up assistance measures for poor people that have been relocated are insufficient , and long-term mechanisms for people to steadily make their way out of poverty have yet to be established . Among poor population , there is a lack of end@@ ogenous drive as well as out@@ mo@@ ded customs and habits are difficult to break away from .
We must properly resolve these problems by setting clear priorities . For problems that must and can be resolved , we should work quickly to find solutions so that they do not hinder us from completing our objectives in the fight against poverty . For certain protracted problems that cannot be solved overnight , we should make overall arrangements and lay the groundwork for them to be resolved in a step-by-step manner .
II . We must focus on resolving outstanding problems concerning the " two assurances and three guarantees . "
The basic requirements and core criteria for poverty alleviation are assuring the rural poor population that they have enough to eat and to wear and guaranteeing them access to compulsory education , basic medical services , and safe housing by 2020 . These goals have a direct bearing on the quality of our fight against poverty .
On the whole , the " two assurances " have essentially been settled , but there are still many areas of weakness in the " three guarantees . "
With regard to guaranteeing access to compulsory education , there are more than 6@@ 00,000 children that have discontinued their studies in the compulsory stage .
Bo@@ arding schools in towns and townships are in@@ sufficiently developed , and it is difficult for some children left behind in rural areas to receive education .
With regard to guaranteeing access to basic medical services , some poor people are not covered by basic medical insurance , and some do not receive prompt treatment for common illnesses and chronic conditions . Medical facilities in poor counties , townships , and villages are insufficient , and some poor villages have no clinics or qualified doctors .
With regard to guaranteeing access to safe housing , throughout the country there are about 1.6 million households in four key groups ( namely households eligible for subsistence allowances , individuals living in extreme poverty on basic assistance in rural areas , families of people with disabilities affected by poverty , and households registered as living in poverty ) that require renovation of their dil@@ ap@@ idated housing , of which 8@@ 00,000 households are registered as living in poverty .
Some rural areas have not carried out assessments of such housing or have failed to ensure the accuracy of these assessments .
With regard to guaranteeing access to safe drinking water , the problem has yet to be resolved for about 1.@@ 04 million poor people , while water safety needs to be further consolidated and enhanced for 60 million rural residents .
If not effectively resolved by 2020 , these problems will greatly de@@ tract from our success in fighting against poverty .
Authorities and departments at all levels must take the above problems seriously , get on the same page , and carry out relevant initiatives effectively .
To resolve outstanding problems concerning the " three guarantees , " we must adhere to systems and mechanisms under which the central government formul@@ ates overarching plans , provincial governments assume overall responsibility , and city and county governments take charge of implementation .
The central leading group on poverty alleviation should enhance overall coordination , oversight , and guidance , and make relevant arrangements in a timely manner .
The Ministry of Education , the Ministry of Housing and Urban@@ -@@ Rural Development , the Ministry of Water Resources , the National Health Commission , and the National Healthcare Security Administration are not only part of the leading group on poverty alleviation , but also responsible for managing work related to the " three guarantees . " Principal leaders of these departments must personally take the initiative , while officials in charge of specific tasks must make concrete efforts .
These departments must define clear standards for their work and establish supporting policies in line with their respective functions , and guide local authorities in analyzing and resolving problems .
Relevant provin@@ ci@@ al-level governments should organize local units to conduct checks , feel out the situation on the ground , organize resources in a coordinated manner , formulate and implement plans , and work out targeted measures .
City and county governments should take responsibility for the implementation of specific initiatives and verify ex@@ its from poverty on a case-by-case and house@@ hol@@ d-@@ by-@@ household basis to ensure that no blind spots exist .
I have emphasized on many occasions that we must adhere to current poverty alleviation standards and refrain from raising or lowering them .
Guarante@@ eing access to compulsory education mainly entails ensuring that the school-@@ age children of poor families complete their education .
Guarante@@ eing access to basic medical services mainly entails ensuring that all poor people are covered by the medical insurance system , that there are facilities where they can access affordable treatment for common illnesses and chronic conditions , and that they can maintain a basic standard of living in the event that they become seriously ill .
Guarante@@ eing access to safe housing mainly entails ensuring that poor people do not live in dil@@ ap@@ idated housing .
Guarante@@ eing access to safe drinking water mainly entails ensuring that rural citizens feel at ease about the water they drink and that we make coordinated efforts to analyze and resolve safety issues in this regard .
These are the country ’ s unified , basic standards , but conditions vary from region to region .
For example , with regard to ensuring housing safety , the southern region should focus on ventilation , while the northern region should focus on heating and insulation .
With regard to ensuring the safety of drinking water , the north@@ western region should focus on finding adequate sources of water , while the south@@ western region should focus on the storage and delivery of water as well as on bringing water quality up to required standards .
Therefore , different localities should act in line with actual conditions rather than trying to use " one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all " solutions .
Exten@@ sive inquiries have been made by various localities into how to resolve outstanding problems concerning the " three guarantees , " with some either wit@@ tingly or un@@ wit@@ tingly raising standards .
Such practices should be rec@@ tified if they markedly exceed standards . If standards are only exceeded by a small margin , however , then the stability and continuity of policies should be maintained in order to prevent too much ch@@ opping and changing .
To resolve outstanding problems concerning the " two assurances and three guarantees , " it is essential to acquire a clear sense of basic conditions . Some localities have still failed to do so , and this is unacceptable .
Relevant departments must guide all localities in getting a clear sense of basic conditions to ensure that they are working toward definite goals .
Relevant departments should also enhance verification and connection of data in order to avoid inconsistencies between different departments .
Supervisory departments for relevant industries should take the lead in formulating work plans , while provin@@ ci@@ al-level governments should formulate implementation plans , set timetables and road@@ maps , and come up with effective measures and methods to ensure that tasks are completed on schedule .
Our policies and funds for resolving outstanding problems concerning the " three guarantees " are sufficient ; the key is ensuring that they are applied effectively .
We need to intensify our efforts , focus on outstanding problems , and rectify deficiencies on a per-@@ village , per-@@ household , and per-@@ case basis .
We also need to publicize our policies and standards to ensure that we are all on the same page , and guide all sectors of society in accurately understanding these policies so as to prevent the emergence of varying interpretations .
III . We must make solid efforts this year and next in the fight against poverty .
Taking everything into account , China has already essentially achieved the goal of building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects . However , there remain some shortcomings , the greatest of which is in our fight against poverty .
The fight against poverty has now entered a crucial stage for us to secure a decisive victory . Our approach in this stage should differ from the overall planning of the initial stage and the overall advancement of the intermediate stage since now the most urgent task is to prevent our efforts from sl@@ ack@@ ening or sli@@ pping .
All localities and departments must press on without res@@ pite , not letting up until a complete victory has been secured .
First , we must strengthen accountability .
As a Chinese saying goes , “ Cap@@ able people attach greater importance to conscienti@@ ousness than to resour@@ ce@@ fulness . ”
W@@ inning the fight against poverty is a task that must be fulfilled if we are to build a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
Principal leaders of provin@@ ci@@ al-level Party committees and governments must boost awareness of the need to maintain political integrity , think in big@@ -@@ picture terms , follow the CPC central leadership core , and keep in alignment ; strengthen their confidence in the path , theory , system , and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics ; resolutely uphold the General Secretary ’ s core position on the CPC Central Committee and in the Party as a whole , and resolutely uphold the CPC Central Committee ’ s authority and its centralized , unified leadership ; and heigh@@ ten their political responsibility as they take action in the fight against poverty .
Provin@@ ci@@ al-level officials in charge of poverty alleviation must , on account of their special position , ensure that they are well acquainted with relevant circumstances and build expertise so that they can effectively advise and assist in the implementation of initiatives .
Each province should select and appoint capable officials to take charge of poverty alleviation efforts . Leadership should remain stable in principle , but adjustments should be made where officials are found to be un@@ suited to their post or incapable of performing their duties .
All industries and government departments must put their utmost effort toward our poverty alleviation objectives , working together and ensuring that they perform their duties . Those who hinder the fulfillment of our goals due to their failure to assume responsibilities , implement policies , and carry out initiatives must be held to account .
Second , we must overcome the most difficult challenges in poverty alleviation .
Our efforts to address problems in areas with extreme poverty , poor basic conditions , complex causes of poverty , and overlapping ethnic , religious , and stability issues are the key in determining whether we can win the battle against poverty .
In June 2017 in Shanxi , I presided over a symposium on poverty alleviation in deeply impoverished areas , calling for concentrated efforts to lift deeply impoverished areas such as the “ three regions and three prefec@@ tures ” out of poverty .
After the meeting , the CPC Central Committee formulated guidelines for supporting poverty alleviation in these areas . Though various sectors have intensified their efforts in this regard , we must make sure that efforts do not sl@@ ack@@ en .
There are certain deeply impoverished counties aside from the “ three regions and three prefec@@ tures ” where we need to redouble our efforts and work out specific and pragmatic measures through a step-by-step approach so that we may overcome difficult obstacles and ensure that poverty alleviation tasks are completed .
Third , we must work earnestly to rectify problems .
The most recent round of special inspections and impact assessments of poverty alleviation has discovered numerous outstanding and endemic problems , which mainly exist in the following areas .
The first is failure to regard poverty alleviation as a major political task . This results in inadequate assumption of responsibility , dis@@ cord@@ ant thinking , and l@@ ack@@ l@@ uster implementation .
The second is deviation from the principle of targeted poverty alleviation . Some have reduced poverty alleviation to mere distribution of money and supplies , dividends from community businesses , or subsistence allowances instead of focusing their energy on doing precise work .
The third is excessive form@@ alism and bureaucratic practices . For instance , some have spent money on white@@ washing walls , which brings no benefit at all to the public and only constitutes a poin@@ tless waste of the country ’ s money .
In addition , local officials have been brought to the point of exhaustion by the large numbers of meetings to attend , inspections to conduct , and forms to fill out .
Authorities of all regions and departments should take a full inventory of problems and ensure that problems in every category are properly rec@@ tified , so that we may lay sound foundations for next year ’ s work .
Fourth , we must raise the quality of poverty alleviation .
Poverty alleviation must give consideration to both quantity and quality , but put greater focus on the latter . We cannot allow a scenario in which all localities claim that they have completed their poverty alleviation tasks on schedule but then slip back into poverty en mass@@ e a year or two down the line .
Adop@@ ting a multi-@@ la@@ ye@@ red approach , we must raise the quality of poverty alleviation and consolidate the results of our efforts in this regard .
We must strictly control ex@@ its from poverty by rig@@ orously enforcing relevant standards and procedures to ensure that poverty alleviation initiatives are genuinely effective and reach those who truly need help .
We should prioritize the prevention of rel@@ ap@@ se into poverty , conduct timely follow-up checks on people lifted out of poverty , and offer prompt assistance to those rel@@ ap@@ sing into poverty as well as new cases of poverty .
We should look into forming long-term mechanisms for people to steadily make their way out of poverty , including strengthening poverty alleviation by developing industries in poor areas and chann@@ eling consumer spending to these areas , enhancing relevant training , and promoting non@@ agricultural employment opportunities for the surplus rural workforce so that poor people can find stable jobs .
We need to provide adequate follow-up support to people that have been relocated , and ensure that our poverty alleviation efforts help people build the confidence and capacity to pull themselves out of poverty so that the campaign is equipped with sustainable internal drive .
Fifth , we must keep our poverty alleviation policies stable .
As an old Chinese saying goes , “ The most difficult part of a victory is not winning it , but rather sustaining it . ”
In the first half of this year , more than 430 poor counties will bid f@@ arewell to poverty . During the assessment process , it was found that some counties that had sha@@ ken off the designation of being poor have grown sl@@ ugg@@ ish in their efforts since last year .
Some have put their feet up and abandoned poverty alleviation projects , and some have shifted their focus elsewhere . Party committee secret@@ aries and administrators in some counties have shown eag@@ er@@ ness to be transferred to other posts , and some people that have been lifted out of poverty have seen their incomes stagn@@ ate or even decrease .
After shaking off the designation of being poor , counties must continue to complete the task of lifting their remaining poor out of poverty , and keep those who have already been lifted out of poverty from falling back in .
In these counties , Party and government leadership should remain stable with officials aware that they still bear responsibility , major poverty alleviation policies should remain in force so that they are followed through with , poverty alleviation teams should remain in place so that they continue to provide assistance , and oversight should be prioritized to prevent people from sli@@ pping back into poverty .
Relevant departments must work quickly to propose specific ways of satisfying these requirements .
Sixth , we must improve our conduct .
We need to incorporate the requirement of comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline throughout the entire process of our fight to eradicate poverty , and improve our conduct in order to ensure that concrete efforts are made to alleviate poverty , that channels to exit from poverty are sound , and that poverty alleviation leads to genuine results .
We need to implement and improve systems and mechanisms for promoting poverty alleviation through Party building , effectively train poverty alleviation officials , and enhance the abilities of officials at all levels while insti@@ lling within them a stronger sense of mission and responsibility .
We need to exert the crucial role of local Party organizations in leading the general public out of poverty and toward prosperity , push deeper with efforts to combat corruption and misconduct in poverty alleviation , and implement policy decisions designed to ease the burdens on localities .
The vast majority of officials working on the front lines of poverty alleviation have kept their mission firmly in mind , and worked hard for the wellbeing of the poor . Some have long been over@@ loaded in their work , some have had no time to take care of their families and children , some have exhausted themselves to the point that they are unable to go on for health reasons , and some have even sacrificed their lives .
We must show great care for the lives , health , and safety of those serving on the front lines of the fight against poverty , and immediately provide subsidies and long-term support for the families of deceased officials .
We must see that officials who have performed well and won public approval at the local level are effectively trained and put to good use .
We must also enhance publicity and commend outstanding officials so that the public is aware of stories of hero@@ ism from the fight against poverty .
Finally , with regard to poverty alleviation officials who fl@@ inch in the face of difficulty , mud@@ dle through their work , or st@@ oop to deception , we must enhance education and supervision , replacing those who should be replaced and holding to account those who should be held accountable .
W@@ inning the fight against poverty is a historic mission that is both glorious and immen@@ sely challenging . If we are to attain complete success in this mission , we must continue putting in ardu@@ ous efforts .
We must press on with courage and resolve , making new and greater contributions so that we may realize our goals of winning the fight against poverty and building a moder@@ ately prosperous society on schedule .
Fos@@ tering a New Development Parad@@ ig@@ m and Pursu@@ ing Mutual Benefit and W@@ in-@@ win Cooperation
– Key@@ note Address at the APEC CEO Di@@ alogues
H.E. Xi Jinping , President of the People ’ s Republic of China
Beijing , 19 November 2020
Leaders of the Business Community , Ladies and Gent@@ le@@ men , Dear Friends ,
At a critical time when the world is fighting CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 and exploring ways to achieve economic recovery , I am glad to have this dialogue with you through video links .
This is an unusual time in history for us humanity . The CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 pandemic has accelerated changes un@@ seen in a century in the world .
The global economy finds itself into deep recession , its industrial and supply chains are disrupted , and governance , trust , development and peace deficits continue to grow .
Moun@@ ting unil@@ ater@@ alism , protectionism and bul@@ lying as well as back@@ lash against economic globalization have added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy .
However , peace and development remain the underlying trend of our times . Meeting challenges through cooperation is the only way forward for us in the international community .
This pandemic once again shows that the interests of all countries are closely inter@@ woven and that humankind shares a common stake . Indeed , our world is an indivisible community with a shared future .
To beat the virus and promote global recovery , we in the international community must close ranks and jointly respond to this crisis and meet the test .
All countries should act in the spirit of partnership and get through this tough time together . We need to step up policy communication and coordination , intensify all-round global cooperation against CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 and keep global economy open . By doing so , we can defeat the virus at an early date and achieve robust , sustainable , balanced and inclusive growth for all .
Since the start of this year , facing the sudden on@@ sla@@ ught of CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 , China has put people and life above everything else . The 1.4 billion Chinese people , united as one , have made a major strategic achievement in fighting the virus .
We have ende@@ avo@@ red to both contain the virus and speed@@ ily bring production and life back to normal , thus maintaining economic and social development .
China ’ s economy resumed positive overall growth in the first three quarters this year .
This hard-@@ won achievement speaks volumes about the resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy .
The fundamentals sustaining China ’ s steady and long-term economic growth remain unchanged . We have full confidence and ability to maintain stable economic performance and achieve the goals of finishing the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects and eradicating poverty within the set time frame .
At its recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee , the Communist Party of China deliber@@ ated on and adopted the recommendations for formulating China ’ s 14th Five-@@ Year Plan . According to the recommendations , China will complete building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects within the set time frame . From next year on , China will embark on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country . We will develop a full understanding of the new development stage , and apply the new development philosophy . We will foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the main@@ stay and domestic and international circul@@ ations reinforcing each other .
The new development paradigm is a strategic decision we have made based on the current stage and conditions of development in China and with full consideration given to economic globalization and changes in the external environment .
First , we will expand domestic demand as a strategic priority and ensure smooth flow of economic activity .
In recent years , China ’ s development model of reliance on foreign markets and resources has gone through some gradual changes . The ratio of foreign trade to GDP dropped from 67 percent in 2006 to less than 32 percent in 2019 , while the ratio of current account surplus to GDP has come down from 9.9 percent in 2007 to less than one percent today .
In seven years since the 2008 global financial crisis , the contribution of China ’ s domestic demand to GDP exceeded 100 percent , making domestic consumption the main driver of its growth .
In promoting domestic and international circul@@ ations , the Chinese economy has become much more domestically driven and the performance of China ’ s development has been significantly enhanced . Fos@@ tering a new development paradigm will enable China to better adjust its economic structure and achieve high-quality development .
China will continue to deepen supply-@@ side structural reforms and further expand domestic demand . Doing so will make production , distribution , flow of goods and services , and consumption in China more based on domestic market , and it will make the supply system better adapt to domestic demand . This will us@@ her in a higher stage of well-@@ adjusted balance where demand drives supply and supply , in turn , creates demand .
Second , we will vigorously make scientific and technological innovations to foster new growth drivers .
A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is gathering pace , and science and technology are playing an even more significant role in boosting social productivity .
To China , innovation has always been the primary driver of development , and we have made major achievements by implementing an innov@@ ation-@@ driven development strategy .
As China enters a new stage of development , factors of production under@@ pinning its development have gone through profound changes . This means that China must pursue innovation to achieve high-quality growth driven by domestic demand .
We will fully leverage the demand of our super-@@ sized domestic market and the strengths of its complete industrial system and redouble efforts to turn research outcomes into real productivity . We will endeavor to build an innovation system that integrates science and technology , education , industries and the financial sector , and upgrade the industrial chains . This will sustain China ’ s long-term economic development .
Third , we will continue to deepen reform and energ@@ ize the market .
What we have achieved during the past 40-@@ plus years of China ’ s reform and open@@ ing-up shows one thing : Reform is crucial for unle@@ ashing and boosting productivity .
China has entered a new stage of development and faces new tasks of reform . We will take more steps and remove with greater resolve deep-@@ seated systemic and institutional barriers to modernize China ’ s governance system and capacity .
We will enhance our ability to better apply the new development philosophy , namely , one of pursuing innovative , coordinated , green , open and shared development . We will transform the growth model , upgrade quality and performance , and make growth drivers more robust . We will accelerate the building of a moderni@@ zed economy , strengthen protection of property and intellectual property rights , set up a high-@@ standard market system and improve mechanisms for fair competition . All this will fully motivate all types of market entities .
Ladies and Gent@@ le@@ men , Friends ,
Open@@ ness enables a country to move forward , while sec@@ lu@@ sion holds it back .
In today ’ s world where economic globalization has become an irreversible trend , no country can develop itself by keeping its doors closed . China is already deeply integrated into the global economy and the international system .
We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by “ dec@@ ou@@ pling ” or forming a small circle to keep others out .
By fostering a new development paradigm , we are not pursuing a clos@@ ed-@@ door circulation , but open and mutually reinforcing domestic and international circul@@ ations .
– The new development paradigm will enable China to fully unlock its market potential and create greater demand for other countries .
China ’ s per capita GDP has top@@ ped US $ 10,000 , and its middle-income population has exceeded 400 million . It is projected by many international institutions that China ’ s retail market will reach six trillion dollars in size this year .
As China ’ s economy grows , our people naturally want to lead an even better life . This will create more demand for a greater variety of quality products , technologies and services from across the world .
Despite the damage inflicted by CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 , China ’ s import of goods has basically recovered to the level of last year .
The China International Fair for Trade in Services held in Beijing this September brought together 2@@ 2,000 companies from 148 countries and regions to its online and off line events .
Not long ago , the third China International Import Expo was successfully held in Shanghai . It was participated by companies from 124 countries and regions . The exhibition area was further expanded . More deals were sealed , reaching US $ 7@@ 2.@@ 62 billion in value .
China will further cut tariffs and government instituted transaction costs , and open a number of demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade to increase import of quality goods and services .
I am confident that the steady unle@@ ashing of the China market potential will create vast business possibilities for other countries , and this will create stronger impetus for maintaining stable growth of the global economy .
– The new development paradigm will enable China to open up wider and share more opportunities for common development with other countries .
China is committed to open@@ ing-up , which is its fundamental policy , a policy that will not change at any time .
The world economy has faced more instability and uncertainty this year . Protec@@ tion@@ ism and unil@@ ater@@ alism are mounting . Yet China has not st@@ alled in its pursuit of open@@ ing-up . As a matter of fact , we have taken many policy steps to open the country still wider . It includes the following : The Foreign Investment Law and its supporting rules and regulations have been fully implemented . The negative list for foreign investment has been further cut . Access to the financial market has been steadily eased . A master plan has been drawn up for the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port . Reform and open@@ ing-up in Shenzhen and Pudong have been further advanced . And more pilot programs have been conducted for creative promotion of trade in services .
I wish to reiterate that China ’ s commitment to open@@ ing-up is strong , and that China will open its door still wider to the world .
China will continue to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation , to conclude , through negotiation , high-@@ standard free trade agreements with more countries , and to actively engage in bilateral , multilateral and regional mechanisms for trade and investment cooperation . The purpose is to build a higher-@@ standard open economy in China .
China will improve its system for foreign investment management based on pre-@@ establishment national treatment and negative list . The lawful rights and interests of foreign investors will be protected . China will open up the service sector in a well-@@ planned way , and foster a market-@@ oriented , world-class business environment under@@ pinned by a sound legal framework .
China will give its pilot free trade zones greater power in carrying out reform , and turn them into new pac@@ es@@ et@@ ters of open@@ ing-up .
At the same time , China will continue to firmly support the multilateral trading system , get more actively involved in reforming the system of global economic governance , and play its part to make this system fai@@ rer and more equitable .
The new development paradigm will enable China to continue to deepen international cooperation for shared benefits .
China will take a more active part in the international division of labor , get more effectively integrated into global industrial , supply and value chains , and more enthusias@@ tically expand exchanges and cooperation with other countries .
We welcome cooperation with every other region , country , or company that wants to do so .
China will remain committed to openness and cooperation , and adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits . China will work to pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with its partners , and seek greater complementarity between the development strategies and connectivity plans of regions and countries concerned . China will further harmonize policies , rules and standards with BR@@ I partners , and deepen effective cooperation with them on infrastructure , industry , trade , scientific and technological innovation , public health and people@@ -to-@@ people exchange . Together , we will make the Belt and Road a model of cooperation , health , recovery and growth and deepen cooperation on green development . This will allow us to contribute to common development and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind .
Ladies and Gent@@ le@@ men , Friends ,
The Asia-Pacific is our shared home . To sustain peace , stability , development and prosperity in the region meets the interests of us all .
As Asia-Pacific economies are connected by the same ocean , we benefit from close interactions between our peoples and geographic proximity .
We should follow market trends , seize opportunities created by economic globalization and regional economic integration and become fore@@ run@@ ners driving global growth .
The development of the Asia-Pacific and greater economic cooperation in our region represent an underlying historical trend , and such development and cooperation will continue to be im@@ bu@@ ed with strong vitality , because they respond to the call of the people in our region .
Last year , I proposed building an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future featuring openness , inclusiveness , innov@@ ation-@@ driven growth , greater connectivity and mutually beneficial cooperation .
This year , thanks to participation of all economies concerned , the APEC Post-@@ 2020 Vision has been formulated , which sets out ambitious goals and important guidelines for our future cooperation .
Let us not forget that we are a community with a common stake , and let us move toward closer regional economic integration . We need to accelerate innov@@ ation-@@ driven growth , enhance regional connectivity , and realize inclusive and sustainable development . Step by step , we can surely turn our vision into reality and deliver a better life for people in the region .
The Asia-Pacific business community is an engine driving economic growth . You have witnessed development and cooperation in our region ; and indeed , you have contributed to it every step on the way . You have an important role to play in shaping the future of our region , and there is no doubt you will benefit from its development .
Asia-Pacific cooperation has entered a new historical stage at a time when the world is facing multiple challenges .
The business community needs a broader vision , greater resilience and stronger entrepreneurship .
With them , I am sure you will create greater prospects for business development .
I hope you will contribute your share to promoting openness and development . You may work to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation , and ensure the security and stability of industrial and supply chains of our region ; and your work will enable the Asia-Pacific to take the lead in achieving economic recovery and prosperity .
I hope you will explore innov@@ ation-@@ driven growth . You may take bold steps to pursue organizational , technological and market innovations ; that will make the Asia-Pacific a fertile ground for scientific break@@ through@@ s and a pac@@ es@@ etter for innovation .
I hope you will be partners for achieving win-win cooperation . You may tap fully into the potential for cooperation , and make the pie of cooperation even bigger for all our people to benefit from .
I hope you will actively fulfill your social responsibilities . You may all play active parts in the international fight against CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 and do more to help disadvantaged groups to add more momentum to global development .
Ladies and Gent@@ le@@ men , Dear Friends ,
The day will come when we finally beat CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 and win victory in this fight .
Let us work in solidarity and weather the storm together . Let us stay true to openness and cooperation and make development and circul@@ ations at home and overseas reinforce each other . Together , we can surely deliver a brighter future for all of us , both here in the Asia-Pacific and across the world !
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future
– Remarks at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders ’ Meeting
H.E. Xi Jinping , President of the People ’ s Republic of China
Beijing , 20 November 2020
The Right Honor@@ able Prime Minister Tan Sri Mu@@ hy@@ idd@@ in Y@@ ass@@ in , Dear Col@@ le@@ agues ,
It gives me great pleasure to join you via video link . I wish to thank Prime Minister Mu@@ hy@@ idd@@ in Y@@ ass@@ in and the Malaysian government for hosting the meeting .
The past 30-@@ plus years since the inception of APEC has seen rapid evolution of the international landscape and profound transformation of global governance . It has also witnessed a sea change in the Asia-Pacific region .
Over the past three decades and more , APEC cooperation has kept deepening and made substantial progress on many fronts . Guided by the Bog@@ or Goals , we have steadily enhanced regional economic integration .
We have advanced trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in tan@@ dem with economic and technical cooperation , with a view to realizing mutual complementarity and balanced development of the “ two wheels ” of APEC cooperation .
We have advocated open region@@ alism and developed an APEC approach of volun@@ tar@@ ism , consensus-@@ building , flexibility , prag@@ m@@ atism and incremental progress . Over the years , the Asia-Pacific has wea@@ thered two financial crises and lifted over one billion people out of poverty . It has become a leading and most dynamic power@@ house of the global economy , playing an active role in building an open world economy , upholding the multilateral trading system , and spear@@ heading economic globalization .
Three decades on , both the world and the Asia-Pacific are experiencing profound changes , a process further accelerated by CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 .
The world economy is in the dol@@ drums . Economic globalization is encoun@@ tering head@@ winds . Un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism and protectionism are on the rise . Bal@@ ancing equity and efficiency , growth and distribution , and technology and employment is getting more difficult . The wealth gap remains a common sight . The global governance system faces new challenges .
For the first time in decades , the Asia-Pacific as a whole registered negative economic growth . Protecting people ’ s health and revi@@ ving the economy are two formidable tasks we have to take on .
Where should Asia-Pacific cooperation be heading ? The answer bears on the development of our region , the well-being of our people , and the future of the world at large .
One priority on this year ’ s APEC agenda is to unve@@ il the post-@@ 2020 vision , a pathway toward our goal of building an Asia-Pacific community .
This should be taken as a new starting point for us to begin another phase in Asia-Pacific cooperation , sustain the strong momentum of development in our region , and embrace a future of shared prosperity . Together , we can build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future featuring openness and inclusiveness , innov@@ ation-@@ driven growth , greater connectivity , and mutually beneficial cooperation .
First , we need to stay open and inclusive .
The world economy is like the Pacific Ocean around us – It admits water from various rivers , and connects different parts of the world . As such , it has acquired a vast magnitude and enormous vitality .
The approach of pursuing cooperation as equals and resolving differences with mutual respect is what essentially makes economic development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific possible .
Throughout the years , APEC has committed itself to deepening regional economic integration and made significant progress in implementing the Bog@@ or Goals . It has also played an important role in steering the evolution of the multilateral trading system .
Yet it must be noted that free and open trade and investment cannot be achieved overnight .
It is important that the Asia-Pacific should remain the bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther in safeguarding peace and stability , upholding multilateralism , and fostering an open world economy . We must stay as determined as ever to support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core , promote free and open trade and investment , and make economic globalization more open , inclusive , balanced and beneficial to all .
Continued efforts are needed to press ahead with regional economic integration for the early realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific ( F@@ TA@@ AP ) .
China welcomes the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RC@@ EP ) , and will favor@@ ably consider joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-@@ Pacific Partnership ( CP@@ TP@@ P ) .
As we continue to work on free and open trade , we should pay no less attention to economic and technical cooperation .
We need to further implement the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality Growth and the Action Agenda on Adv@@ ancing Inclusion , and accommodate the concerns of developing members . We need to address in particular the special needs of women and some other communities , and support micro , small and medium-sized enterprises ( M@@ SMEs ) . Such efforts will contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth .
China will host a seminar on advancing economic inclusion through trade and investment to look for suggestions on how trade and investment policies could deliver broader benefits to people .
China looks forward to working with all parties to follow up on those suggestions .
Second , we need to pursue innov@@ ation-@@ driven growth .
The digital economy represents the future direction of global development , while innovation has fu@@ eled the economic take@@ off of the Asia-Pacific .
We need to proactively seize the opportunities of our times and fully harness our region ’ s abundant human resources , solid technological foundation , and enormous market potential to gain a new competitive edge and open up new possibilities for the bet@@ ter@@ ment of our people ’ s lives .
The APEC Internet and Digital Economy Road@@ map should be implemented in full to spur the dissemination and application of new technologies , strengthen digital infrastructure , and close the digital divide .
We need to improve economic governance and foster an open , fair , equitable and non-discriminatory environment for businesses .
This year , China has conducted an APEC case study on smart cities , which we hope will contribute to the formulation of guidelines on smart cities and offer an example for innovative urban development across the region .
China calls for experience sharing among APEC members on how to control CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 and achieve economic recovery with digital technologies . China also calls for improving the do@@ ing-@@ digit@@ al-@@ business environment , energ@@ izing market players , and tapping the potential of the digital economy . Such efforts will bring fresh impetus to economic recovery in our region .
Next year , China will host a workshop on digital technolog@@ y-@@ enabled poverty alleviation , in a bid to unle@@ ash the role of digital technologies in eradicating poverty in our region .
Third , we need to enhance connectivity .
Connec@@ tivity is a vital basis of regional economic integration and an essential under@@ pinning for interconnected development of the world . The ongoing pandemic further highlights the importance of connectivity .
We need to continue to implement the APEC Connec@@ tivity Blue@@ print to facilitate the smooth , safe and orderly flow of people , goods , capital and data and achieve a seamlessly connected Asia-Pacific .
China has opened “ fast tracks ” with fellow APEC members like Indonesia , the Republic of Korea , and Singapore to facilitate the movement of people during the pandemic , and more will be done to complete a network of such arrangements .
In this connection , it is important to promote the mutual recognition of the CO@@ VID@@ -related health information of international travelers .
China is ready to take active and well-@@ though@@ t-out steps with all other parties to set up “ green lanes ” , which will help make customs clearance more efficient , un@@ clo@@ g bottlenecks , and re@@ connect disrupted links . We may also promote the creation of international cooperation platforms on industrial and supply chains to ensure the safe and smooth operation of industrial and supply chains in our region and beyond .
We need to pursue greater complementarity among the development plans and connectivity initiatives of different parties to forge a bigger synergy .
On China ’ s part , we hope to work with all partners in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation , which we believe will set up a bigger platform for connectivity in the Asia-Pacific and inject a stronger impetus into the economy of our region and the wider world .
Fourth , we need to promote mutually beneficial cooperation .
The Asia-Pacific economies have a high degree of mutual complementarity and enjoy deeply inter@@ tw@@ ined interests .
Our economic cooperation has never been a zero-@@ sum political game in which one gains at the expense of the other . Rather , our cooperation has provided us with a development platform to ensure what we each do can be mutually reinforcing and beneficial to all .
“ bu@@ kit s@@ ama did@@ aki , l@@ urah s@@ ama d@@ it@@ ur@@ un@@ i ” , which means to climb the hill together and go down the ra@@ vine together .
It ap@@ tly captures the spirit of our Asia-Pacific family .
There is a Malay pro@@ verb that goes , CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 serves as another reminder that only solidarity and cooperation can enable us to prevail over challenges .
We need to deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust , inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation and follow the approach of extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits .
We need to keep raising the level and scope of our regional cooperation to achieve shared prosperity for the whole region . It is important that we advance practical cooperation on the basis of consensus , properly manage differences and dis@@ agreements , and keep Asia-Pacific cooperation in the right direction to ensure APEC ’ s sound development in the long run .
At this very moment , fighting CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 is the most pressing task for us all .
We must step up research and development of vaccines and related exchanges , and work harder to make the vaccines a global public good to improve their accessibility and affor@@ dability in developing countries .
For that purpose , China has joined the CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 Vacc@@ ine Global Access Facility ( CO@@ V@@ AX ) .
We support APEC in strengthening policy exchanges and capacity building in the areas of public health and M@@ SMEs . China has made a tele@@ medicine initiative to give people in poor and remote areas access to timely and quality medical services . We hope these efforts will contribute to anti-@@ epidemic cooperation and economic recovery .
China highly values the role of APEC . We will continue to support the organization ’ s development , and with our root struck deep in the Asia-Pacific , we will continue to serve its development and prosperity .
Col@@ le@@ agues ,
This year , the Chinese people have exerted st@@ ren@@ uous efforts to score a major strategic achievement in controlling CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 .
Working with other countries in these trying times , China has contributed its wisdom and resources to the global fight against the coron@@ a@@ virus .
It has shared with various parties full experience on containment and treatment and done its best to assist other countries and international organizations . All these are among the concrete actions we have taken toward building a global community of health for all .
At the same time , we have coordinated CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 control with economic and social development at home , and scaled up macro policy response so that the Chinese economy could stabilize , pick up , and steadily upgrade .
In the first three quarters of this year , China ’ s GDP grew by 0.7 percent , on course to register positive growth for the whole year . It is also worth noting that by the end of this year , we will have lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line .
The recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee adopted recommendations for formulating China ’ s 14th five-year plan . The plen@@ um underscored that China will finish building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects within the set time frame , and will embark on a new journey next year toward fully building a modern socialist country . Based on a scientific analysis of the new stage of China ’ s development , we will stay committed to the new development philosophy , and actively foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the main@@ stay and domestic and international circul@@ ations reinforcing each other .
China will build a new system of open economy of higher standards and create a more attractive investment and business environment .
To conclude , China is ready to work with all other parties in the Asia-Pacific to build and share a brighter future of peace and prosperity for our region and get ever closer to the goal of a community with a shared future for mankind .
I thank you all .
He called for efforts to write a new chapter in prioritizing ecological conservation and boosting green development , create a new model for regional coordinated development , create a new height for high-level open@@ ing-up , foster advantages in innov@@ ation-@@ led development , and draw a new painting featuring harmony between nature , the people and the cities .
Such efforts are aimed at turning the Yangtze River Economic Belt into the country 's main focus for green development , the major artery for a smooth " dual circulation " of domestic and international markets , and the main force spear@@ heading high-quality economic development , he said .
After hearing reports from seven officials that include ministers and provincial Party chiefs , Xi said over the past five years , transitional changes have taken place in the ecological and environmental protection along the Yangtze River Economic Belt while historical achievements have been achieved in the area 's economic and social development .
Provinces and municipalities along the Yangtze River have done a good job in handling the CO@@ VID@@ -@@ 19 epidemic and coping with the shocks brought by huge floods as well as external environmental changes , making a prominent contribution for China to first restore positive growth among major economies , he said .
Xi said that promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is an important strategy that has a bearing on the overall national development , noting that the Yangtze River Economic Belt consists of 11 provinces and municipalities and accounts for about half of China 's population and GDP .
Efforts should be made to strengthen the protection and restoration of ecological and environmental systems and coordinated work of the upper , middle , and lower reaches of the Yangtze River , Xi said .
Xi called for comprehensively improving the efficiency of resource utilization and accelerating green and low-@@ carbon development on the premise of strictly protecting the ecological environment .
The restoration of the ecological environment of the Yangtze River should be a major priority , Xi said , adding that the establishment of a mechanism should be accelerated whereby protection and restoration of the ecological environment shall be reasonably rewarded , while those responsible for the ecological environment destruction shall pay their due price .
Xi stressed efforts to explore effective ways conducive to promoting smooth domestic circulation , advance the coordinated development of the upper , middle , and lower reaches of the Yangtze River , promote people-@@ centered new urbanization , and increase people 's life quality and income .
To create a new height for high-level open@@ ing-up , Xi urged efforts to promote innovative development of trade and make better use of foreign capital .
Provinces and municipalities along the Yangtze River should find their respective positions in the new development pattern of " dual circulation " and take the initiative to open up their markets to the world , Xi said .
Efforts should also be made to better integrate the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Belt and Road Initiative , he added .
Xi stressed the need to accelerate the upgrading of the industrial base and the modernization of the industrial chain .
" We should take bold steps in innovation and focus on the real economy to boost economic development , " he said , adding that the country should speed up break@@ through@@ s in key and core technologies .
He also urged efforts to strengthen the dominant position of enterprises in innovation , foster advanced manufacturing clusters with international competitiveness , and build independent , controll@@ able , safe and efficient industrial and supply chains that serve the whole country .
Noting that Yangtze River is the icon of the Chinese nation and the symbol of Chinese civilization , Xi called for protecting , inher@@ iting and carrying forward the Yangtze River culture , as well as protecting its cultural relics and heritage .
He also stressed the need to conduct in-depth research on the key issues that currently constr@@ ain the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt .
Vice Premier Han Zheng , a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the leading group for promoting the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt , attended the symposium .
To promote the development of the economic belt , authorities should apply the new development philosophy throughout the whole process and in all areas , set a good example in promoting high-quality development , and make greater contribution to speeding up the establishment of the new development pattern , Han said .

I. A review of our work in 2019 and the first few months of 2020
In pursuing development last year , China faced many difficulties and challenges . World economic growth was weak , international economic and trade fr@@ ictions intensified , and downward pressure on the domestic economy grew .

We worked to improve Party conduct and build a clean government , started an initiative to raise awareness of the need to stay true to the Party ’ s founding mission , and strictly observed the central Party leadership ’ s eight-@@ point decision on improving work conduct . We continued to address the practice of formalities for formalities ’ sake , bureaucr@@ atism , he@@ don@@ ism , and extr@@ avag@@ ance , and took steps to ensure that people working at the primary level are free from unnecessary restrictions and excessive burdens .

Fellow Deputies ,
Since the coron@@ a@@ virus first emerged , the Party Central Committee has made its containment the top priority . General Secretary Xi Jinping , putting the health and safety of our people before everything else , has personally taken charge and planned our response .
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee , the central leading group for co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 response has made timely decisions and plans ; the central guidance group has provided effective guidance and supervision ; the State Council inter-@@ departmental task force has coordinated the response efforts ; all local authorities and all government departments have fulfilled their respective duties , and people from every walk of life have given their full support . Together , we have w@@ aged an all-@@ out people ’ s war against the virus .
Our medical workers have fought with courage . Our servic@@ emen and women have shoul@@ dered heavy responsibilities . Our scientists and researchers have joined forces in order to find a cure . Our community workers , policemen and women , officials working at the primary level , media personnel , and volunteers have stood fast at their posts . Our deli@@ very@@ men and women , our sanitation workers , and all who make and transport emergency supplies have continued their work with dedication . Hundreds of millions of other workers outside of the spot@@ light have also made their own contributions . In Wuhan City and Hubei Province the people have carried on with for@@ titude and resilience , while people from all sectors of society and our fellow com@@ patri@@ ots in Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan , and overseas have made generous donations , both monetary and in-kind .
Through all these efforts , we , all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , have stood together in the most trying of times and built a Great Wall of solidarity against the epidemic .
Responding to the central Party leadership ’ s call to stay confident , come together in solidarity , adopt a sci@@ ence-based approach , and take targeted measures , we have carried out all our work in a solid and metic@@ ulous manner .
We adopted containment measures promptly , treating co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 as a Class A infectious disease and activ@@ ating a Level One public health emergency response in all localities .
We have achieved a decisive victory in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city Wuhan by firmly implementing strict control measures , r@@ all@@ ying the support of the entire country , and dispat@@ ching over 40,000 doctors and nurses . We built Hu@@ os@@ hen@@ shan and Le@@ ish@@ en@@ shan hospitals as well as cabin hospitals to increase the number of hospital beds within a short time , and ensured the availability of medical supplies . We continuously refined diagnostic and treatment plans , incorporated traditional Chinese medicine into treatment , and concentrated patients , experts and resources in designated facilities to provide treatment , thus doing everything we could to maximize the cure rate and minimize the mortality rate .
We extended the Spring Festival holiday nationwide , postponed the spring semester , facilitated flexible resumption of work , and stag@@ gered comm@@ ute times . We have carried out a soci@@ ety-@@ wide prevention and control effort , ensured early detection , reporting , quarantine , and treatment of cases , firmly controlled sources of infection , and effectively cur@@ bed the spread of the virus .
Inten@@ sive efforts have been made to develop drugs , vaccines , and testing re@@ agents .
We expanded production of medical supplies by a large margin within a short time , ensured supply and price stability of daily necessities , and maintained smooth transportation on trunk lines , as well as stable supplies of coal , electricity , oil , and gas .
In response to changing co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 dynamics , we have adopted regular prevention and control measures in a timely manner .
In the face of the global spread of co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 , we promptly set up a shield against possible imported cases , and we have provided increased care and support for Chinese citizens overseas .
With an open , transparent , and responsible attitude , China has actively engaged in international cooperation , providing timely information , actively sharing prevention technologies and practices , and helping other countries with their response efforts .
As a developing country with 1.4 billion people , it is only by overcoming enormous difficulties that China has been able to contain co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 in such a short time while also ensuring our people ’ s basic needs .
Our success has come at a great price . The economy posted negative growth in the first quarter of this year , and daily life and work have been greatly affected . However , life is invaluable . This is a price we must pay , and a price worth paying . While continuing to advance epidemic control , we have also promoted economic and social development and lost no time in resum@@ ing work and production when appropriate .
With 90 policy measures in 8 categories , we have provided assistance to enterprises to stabilize employment , cut and exempted taxes and fees , exempted all tol@@ ls on highways , reduced the costs of energy use , and introduced subsidized loans .
We have approved in advance ceilings on local government debt in accordance with due procedures .
We have kept up with the spring farming schedule , and continued the critical battle against poverty .
We have provided assistance to people working on the front lines of co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 control and people in difficulty , and doubled temporary price subsidies .
These policies have benefited our people , and ensured the stability of supplies and prices and the resumption of work and production in a timely and effective way . Indeed , the Chinese economy has shown great resilience and enormous potential .
Fellow Deputies ,
We owe what we have achieved in economic and social development since last year and in co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 control this year to the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Com@@ r@@ ade Xi Jinping at its core , the sound guidance of Xi Jinping Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a , and the concerted efforts of the Party , the armed forces , and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups .
On behalf of the State Council , I express sincere gratitude to the people of all ethnic groups , and to all other political parties , people ’ s organizations , and public figures from all sectors of society .
I express heart@@ felt appreciation to our fellow country@@ men and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions , in Taiwan , and overseas .
I also express sincere thanks to the governments of other countries , international organizations , and friends from all over the world , who have shown understanding and support for China in its endeavor to achieve modernization and in its fight against co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 .
While recognizing our achievements , we are also ke@@ enly aware of the difficulties and problems we face . The shock of the co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 pandemic has sent the world economy into severe recession , disrupted industrial and supply chains , and caused a contraction in international trade and investment and volatility in commodity markets .
Dom@@ es@@ tically , consumption , investment , and exports have declined . Pressure on employment has risen significantly . Busin@@ esses , especially private firms and micro , small , and medium enterprises ( M@@ SMEs ) , face growing difficulties . There are increasing risks in the financial sector and other areas . The budgetary imbalances of prim@@ ary-@@ level governments have intensified .
In the work of government there is still room for improvement . Poin@@ tless formalities and bureaucr@@ atism remain an acute issue . A small number of officials are reluctant to take on responsibility , are unwilling or unable to perform their duties , or behave ir@@ responsibly .
Corruption is still a common problem in some fields .
During the co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 response , many weak links have been exposed in public health emergency management , and the people have expressed their views and suggestions , which deserve our attention .
We must strive to improve our work and fulfill our responsibilities and make every effort to live up to the people ’ s expectations .
II . Main targets for development in 2020 and the overall plan for the next stage of work
For the government to deliver this year , we must , under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Com@@ r@@ ade Xi Jinping at its core ,
follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a ;
implement the guiding principles of the Party ’ s 19th National Congress and the second , third , and fourth plenary sessions of its 19th Central Committee in full ;
firmly act on the Party ’ s basic theory , line , and policy ; strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity , think in big@@ -@@ picture terms , follow the leadership core , and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership ; stay confident in the path , theory , system , and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics ; and uphold General Secretary Xi Jinping ’ s core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole , and uphold the Party Central Committee ’ s authority and its centralized , unified leadership ;
carry out co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 control and promote economic and social development to fulfill the targets and tasks for completing the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects ;
while carrying out regular co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 control , continue to follow the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability , apply the new development philosophy , pursue supply-@@ side structural reform as our main task , and draw momentum from reform and opening up to promote high-quality development ;
make progress in the three critical battles ; step up efforts to ensure stability on six fronts and maintain security in six areas ; stead@@ fas@@ tly pursue the strategy of expanding domestic demand , ensure economic development and social stability , accomplish the targets and tasks for winning the battle against poverty , and bring to completion the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
At present and for some time to come , China will face challenges like never before . However , we have unique political and institutional strengths , a strong economic foundation , enormous market potential , and hundreds of millions of intelligent and hard@@ working people .
If we face challenges head@@ -on , boost confidence in development , create strong impetus for growth , and preserve and make the most of this important period of strategic opportunity for our development , we will , without doubt , be able to make it through this challenging time . The horiz@@ ons for China ’ s development are full of promise .
On the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the current situation , we have made proper adjustments to the targets that we were considering before co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 struck .
This year , we must give priority to stabilizing employment and ensuring living standards , win the battle against poverty , and achieve the goal of building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all aspects .
Over 9 million new urban jobs , a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 6 percent , and a registered urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent
CP@@ I increase of around 3.5 percent
More stable and higher-@@ quality imports and exports , and a basic equilibrium in the balance of payments
Growth in personal income that is basically in step with economic growth
Elimination of poverty among all rural residents living below the current poverty line and in all poor counties
Effective prevention and control of major financial risks
A further drop in energy consumption per unit of GDP and the discharge of major pollutants
Ac@@ compl@@ ishment of the 13th Five-@@ Year Plan
I would like to point out that we have not set a specific target for economic growth this year . This is because our country will face some factors in its development that are difficult to predict due to the great uncertainty regarding the co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment .
Not setting a specific target for economic growth will enable all of us to concentrate on ensuring stability on the six fronts and security in the six areas .
We must focus on maintaining security in the six areas in order to ensure stability on the six fronts .
By doing so , we will be able to keep the fundamentals of the economy stable .
Maintaining security will deliver the stability needed to pursue progress , thus laying a solid foundation for accompl@@ ishing our goal of building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
We must be clear that efforts to stabilize employment , ensure living standards , eliminate poverty , and prevent and def@@ use risks must be under@@ pinned by economic growth ; so ensuring stable economic performance is of crucial significance .
We must pursue reform and opening up as a means to stabilize employment , ensure people ’ s wellbeing , stimulate consumption , energ@@ ize the market , and achieve stable growth . We need to bl@@ aze a new path that enables us to respond effectively to shocks and sustain a positive growth cycle .
We will pursue a more proactive and imp@@ ac@@ tful fiscal policy .
The defic@@ it@@ -to-@@ GDP ratio this year is projected at more than 3.6 percent , with a deficit increase of one trillion yuan over last year . On top of this , one trillion yuan of government bonds for co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 control will also be issued .
These are extraordinary measures for an unusual time .
The aforementioned two trillion yuan will be transferred in full to local governments ; a special transfer payment mechanism will be set up to ensure that funds go straight to pre@@ fecture and county governments and directly benefit businesses and people . These funds should be primarily used to ensure employment , meet basic living needs , and protect market entities . This includes giving support to cut taxes and fees , reduce rents and interest on loans , and increase consumption and investment . It is important to stress that government funds are public in nature and that no such funds are allowed to be with@@ held or diverted for non-@@ designated uses .
We will work harder to improve the composition of fiscal spending . We will see that spending on people ’ s basic wellbeing is only increased and not cut , ensure spending in key areas , and resolutely cut general expenditures . Construction of new government buildings and waste@@ ful and excessive spending will be strictly prohibited .
Government at all levels must truly tighten its belt . The central government will take the lead by committing to negative growth in its budgetary spending , with a more than 50 percent cut to out@@ lays on non-@@ essential and non-@@ obligatory items .
All types of surplus , idle and car@@ ry@@ over funds that should be taken back will be withdrawn and real@@ located .
We will see that funds are put to better and more effective use ; we will scrutin@@ ize all expenditure items and see that every cent is used where it is needed most and where market entities and the people will feel the greatest benefit from it .
We will pursue a prudent monetary policy in a more flexible and appropriate way .
We will use a variety of tools such as required reserve ratio reductions , interest rate cuts , and re-@@ lending to enable M@@ 2 money supply and aggregate financing to grow at notably higher rates than last year .
We will keep the RMB exchange rate generally stable at an adaptive , balanced level .
As we work to develop new monetary policy instruments that can directly stimulate the real economy , it is crucial that we take steps to ensure enterprises can secure loans more easily , and promote steady reduction of interest rates .
We will strengthen the employ@@ ment-@@ first policy with comprehensive measures .
We will create synergy to stabilize employment through the coordinated use of fiscal , monetary , and investment policies .
We will strive to keep existing jobs secure , work actively to create new ones , and help unemployed people find work .
All local governments need to overhaul or resc@@ ind excessive restrictions on employment , and adopt all possible measures to bolster employment .
Elimin@@ ating poverty is an obligatory task we must complete in order to build a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
We will continue to apply the current poverty alleviation standards , increase inputs into poverty alleviation , and take stronger steps to implement poverty reduction measures , to ensure that all remaining poor people are lifted out of poverty .
We will improve and effectively utilize mechanisms for monitoring and assisting people who fall back into poverty and consolidate our gains in poverty alleviation .
We will endeavor to protect our blue sk@@ ies , clear waters , and clean lands , and meet the goals for the critical battle of pollution prevention and control .
Strong measures will be taken to prevent and control major risks in the financial and other sectors and to fores@@ tall systemic risks .
Almost five months of this year have passed .
In the next stage , we will not let up on any front of our long-term fight against co@@ vid@@ -@@ 19 , nor will we lose any time in advancing China ’ s economic and social development agenda .
The policies we adopt should be both force@@ ful and sustainable , and they may be adjusted as called for .
We have both the resolve and ability to accomplish the targets and tasks set for this year .
III ． For@@ ce@@ fully implementing macro policies to keep businesses and employment stable
To ensure employment and people ’ s wellbeing , we must in@@ still confidence in over one hundred million market entities ; and we must do our utmost to help businesses , particularly M@@ SMEs , and self-employed individuals get through this challenging time .
We will further cut taxes and fees .
We will aggres@@ sively implement current policies in conjunction with institutional arrangements to create a more enabling environment and help market entities overcome difficulties and achieve development .
We will continue implementing the policies introduced last year on lowering VAT rates and the share of employees ’ basic old-@@ age insurance paid by enterprises , and we will make further tax and fee cuts of about 500 billion yuan .
The policies introduced early this year that are due to expire by June will all be extended till the end of the year .
They include the following : exemp@@ ting M@@ SMEs from contributions to basic old-@@ age insurance , unemployment insurance , and work injury compensation insurance schemes ; reducing or canc@@ elling VAT for small-scale taxpayers ; exemp@@ ting VAT on services such as public transportation , restaurants and hotels , tourism and entertainment , and culture and sports ; and reducing or canc@@ elling civil aviation development fund contributions and port development fees .
The payment of corporate income taxes by micro and small businesses and self-employed individuals will be postponed to next year .
We expect that these measures will see additional savings of more than 2.5 trillion yuan for enterprises throughout the year .
All tax and fee reduction policies must be fully implemented for our businesses , so that they can sustain themselves and assure success for the future .
We will reduce enterprises ’ production and operating costs .
The policy of reducing electricity prices for general industrial and commercial businesses by 5 percent will be extended to the end of the year .
The rates for broadband and dedicated internet access services will be cut by 15 percent on average .
R@@ ents for state-owned premises will be lowered or exempted , and all other types of property owners are encouraged to also reduce , waive , or defer rent payments , and they will receive policy support from the government in doing so .
We will take firm steps to stop the unauthorized le@@ vy of fees on enterprises .
We will increase financial support to keep business operations stable .
The policy allowing M@@ SMEs to postpone principal and interest re@@ payments on loans will be further extended till the end of March next year — payments on all inclusive loans of micro and small businesses eligible for this policy should also be deferred , and other businesses facing financial difficulties can discuss similar terms with their creditors .
We will improve assessment and incentive mechanisms and give encouragement to banks to see that they are confident , willing and able to grant loans , make substantial increases to credit loans , first-@@ time loans , and loan renew@@ als without repayment of principal to micro and small businesses , and apply financial technology and big data to reduce service costs and make their services more targeted .
The scope of the government financing guaran@@ ty will be expanded and guaran@@ ty fees will be reduced significantly .
Large commercial banks should increase inclusive finance lending to micro and small businesses by more than 40 percent .
We will encourage the sharing of enterprises ’ credit information . We will support enterprises in increasing bond financing .
We should tighten regulation , prevent funds from simply circulating in the financial sector for the sake of arbitr@@ age , and crack down on debt ev@@ asion . As financial institutions and the businesses that borrow from them share a common stake , we encourage banks to make appropriate interest concessions .
To support market entities , we must ensure that M@@ SMEs have significantly better access to loans and that overall financing costs drop markedly .
We will make every effort to stabilize and expand employment .
We will increase employment support for key sectors and key groups .
With 8.@@ 74 million college students graduating this year , we need to encourage marke@@ t-based employment , ensure that colleges and the governments of localities where they are located provide employment services to these students on an ongoing basis , and expand recruitment to prim@@ ary-@@ level service projects .
We will provide assistance and employment services for demobilized military personnel .
We will adopt a policy to see rural migrant workers have equal access to employment services in the cities where they work . We will assist people with disabilities , zero-@@ employment families , and other groups facing difficulty in securing work .
There are several hundred million workers , including casual lab@@ ore@@ rs , in flexible employment in China . This year , low-income ear@@ ners will be allowed to postpone the payment of their social insurance premiums , all employ@@ ment-related government charges will be cancelled , and sites will be designated for mobile vendors .
We will finance skills training to stabilize and expand employment , step up market-@@ oriented skills training , and encourage work@@ -based training and the joint development and sharing of vocational training centers . This year and next , more than 35 million vocational skills training opportunities will be provided , and enrollment in vocational colleges will grow by 2 million . This will help more people improve their skills and secure jobs .

The Party ’ s ability to innov@@ ate , power to unite , and energy to fight have all been significantly strengthened ;
Party solidarity and unity have been reinforced , and our engagement with the people has been greatly improved . Revolutionary temper@@ ing has made our Party stronger and it now radi@@ ates with great vitality . With this , efforts to develop the cause of the Party and the country have gained a strong political under@@ pinning .
But we must be very clear : There are still many in@@ adequ@@ acies in our work and many difficulties and challenges to face .
The main ones are as follows . Some acute problems caused by un@@ balanced and inadequate development await solutions ; and the quality and effect of development are not what they should be . China ’ s ability to innov@@ ate needs to be stronger , the real economy awa@@ its improvement , and we have a long way to go in protecting the environment .
In work on public wellbeing there are still many areas where we fall short ; and poverty alleviation remains a formidable task . There are still large disparities in development between rural and urban areas , between regions , and in income distribution ;
and our people face many difficulties in employment , education , healthcare , housing , and elderly care . The level of ci@@ vic@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dness needs further improvement . Social tensions and problems are inter@@ tw@@ ined , much remains to be done in seeing the country ’ s governance is based in law , and China ’ s system and capacity for governance need to be further strengthened . Ide@@ ological struggle is still complicated , and in national security we face new developments .
Some reform plans and major policies and measures need to be better implemented . Many dimensions of Party building remain weak .
These are all problems that demand our full attention to resolve .
The achievements of the past five years are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee , and , more importantly , the result of all Party members and all the Chinese people pulling together in their pursuit .
On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , I express our heart@@ felt thanks to the people of all ethnic groups , to all other political parties , to people ’ s organizations , and patri@@ otic figures from all sectors of society , to our fellow country@@ men and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan , to overseas Chinese , and to all our friends from around the world who have shown understanding and support for China ’ s modernization .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
In the early days of reform and opening up , the Party made a cl@@ ar@@ ion ca@@ h@@ v@@ fl@@ l for us to take a path of our own and build socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Since that time , the Party has united and led all the Chinese people in a tireless struggle , prop@@ elling China into a leading position in terms of economic and technological strength , defense capabilities , and composite national strength .
China ’ s international standing has risen as never before .
Our Party , our country , our people , our forces , and our nation have changed in ways without precedent . The Chinese nation , with an entirely new posture , now stands tall and firm in the East .
With decades of hard work , socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era . This is a new historic juncture in China ’ s development .
This is what socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era means : The Chinese nation , which since modern times began had endured so much for so long , has achieved a tremendous transformation : it has stood up , grown rich , and is becoming strong ; it has come to embrace the brilliant prospects of rejuven@@ ation .
It means that scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China , and that the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud for all to see .
It means that the path , the theory , the system , and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing , bl@@ azing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization .
It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence ; and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind .
This new era will be an era of building on past successes to further advance our cause , and of continuing in a new historical context to strive for the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
It will be an era of securing a decisive victory in building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects , and of moving on to all-@@ out efforts to build a great modern socialist country .
It will be an era for the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to work together and work hard to create a better life for themselves and ultimately achieve common prosperity for everyone .
It will be an era for all of us , the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , to strive with one heart to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuven@@ ation . It will be an era that sees China moving closer to center stage and making greater contributions to mankind .
As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved . What we now face is the contradiction between un@@ balanced and inadequate development and the people ’ s ever-@@ growing needs for a better life .
China has seen the basic needs of over a billion people met , has basically made it possible for people to live decent lives , and will soon bring the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society to a successful completion .
The needs to be met for the people to live better lives are increasingly broad .
Not only have their material and cultural needs grown ; their demands for democracy , rule of law , fairness and justice , security , and a better environment are increasing .
At the same time , China ’ s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world .
The more prominent problem is that our development is un@@ balanced and inadequate . This has become the main constr@@ aining factor in meeting the people ’ s increasing needs for a better life .
We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society represents a historic shift that affects the whole landscape and that creates many new demands for the work of the Party and the country .
Building on continued efforts to sustain development , we must devote great energy to addressing development ’ s imbalances and in@@ adequ@@ acies , and push hard to improve the quality and effect of development .
With this , we will be better placed to meet the ever-@@ growing economic , political , cultural , social , and ecological needs of our people , and to promote well-@@ rounded human development and all-round social progress .
We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society does not change our assessment of the present stage of socialism in China .
The basic dimension of the Chinese context — that our country is still and will long remain in the primary stage of socialism — has not changed . China ’ s international status as the world ’ s largest developing country has not changed .
The whole Party must be completely clear about this fundamental dimension of our national context , and must base our work on this most important reality — the primary stage of socialism .
We must remain fully committed to the Party ’ s basic line as the source that keeps the Party and the country going and that brings happiness to the people .
We must lead and unite the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in fulfilling the central task of economic development .
We must uphold the Four Card@@ inal Principles , continue to reform and open up , be self-@@ reli@@ ant , hard@@ working , and enter@@ prising , and strive to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious , and beautiful .
同@@ 志@@ 们 ！
Chinese socialism ’ s entrance into a new era is , in the history of the development of the People ’ s Republic of China and the history of the development of the Chinese nation , of tremendous importance .

Our entire Party should develop un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able confidence , work hard and work well to see socialism with Chinese characteristics display even stronger vitality .
II . The New Er@@ a : The Historic Mission of the Communist Party of China
A hundred years ago , the sal@@ vo@@ es of the October Revolution brought Marx@@ is@@ m-@@ Lenin@@ ism to China .
In the scientific truth of Marx@@ is@@ m-@@ Lenin@@ ism , Chinese progres@@ sives saw a solution to China ’ s problems .
With the advent of modern times , Chinese society became embro@@ iled in intense up@@ heav@@ als ; this was a time of fierce struggle as the Chinese people res@@ isted feudal rule and foreign aggression . It was in the midst of this , in 1921 , as Marx@@ is@@ m-@@ Lenin@@ ism was integrated with the Chinese workers ’ movement , that the Communist Party of China was born .
From that moment on , the Chinese people have had in the Party a backbone for their pursuit of national independence and liberation , of a stronger and more prosperous country , and of their own happiness ; and the mind@@ set of the Chinese people has changed , from pas@@ si@@ vity to taking the initiative .
With a history of more than 5,000 years , our nation created a splendid civilization , made remarkable contributions to mankind , and became one of the world ’ s great nations .
But with the O@@ pi@@ um War of 18@@ 40 , China was plun@@ ged into the darkness of domestic turmoil and foreign aggression ; its people , rav@@ aged by war , saw their homeland torn apart and lived in poverty and despair .
With ten@@ acity and hero@@ ism , countless dedicated patri@@ ots fought , pressed ahead against the odds , and tried every possible means to seek the nation ’ s salvation . But despite their efforts , they were power@@ less to change the nature of society in old China and the plight of the Chinese people .
National rejuven@@ ation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people since modern times began .
At its founding , the Communist Party of China made realizing Commun@@ ism its highest ideal and its ultimate goal , and shoul@@ dered the historic mission of national rejuven@@ ation .
In pursuing this goal , the Party has united the Chinese people and led them through ardu@@ ous struggles to ep@@ ic accomplishments .
Our Party was deeply aware that , to achieve national rejuven@@ ation , it was critical to top@@ ple the three mountains of imperi@@ alism , feud@@ alism , and bureaucr@@ at-@@ capitalism that were op@@ pressing the Chinese people , and realize China ’ s independence , the people ’ s liberation , national reunification , and social stability .
Our Party united the people and led them in embar@@ king on the right revolutionary path , using rural areas to en@@ circle the cities and se@@ izing state power with military force .
We completed the New Democratic Revolution through 28 years of painful struggle , and founded the People ’ s Republic of China in 1949 , thus marking China ’ s great transition from a mill@@ enni@@ a-@@ old feudal auto@@ cr@@ acy to a people ’ s democracy .
Our Party was deeply aware that , to achieve national rejuven@@ ation , it was essential to establish an advanced social system that fits China ’ s reality .
It united the people and led them in completing socialist revolution , establishing socialism as China ’ s basic system , and advancing socialist construction .
This completed the broadest and most profound social transformation in the history of the Chinese nation .
It created the fundamental political conditions and the institutional foundation for achieving all development and progress in China today .
Thus was made a great transition : The Chinese nation reversed its fate from the continuous decline of modern times to steady progress toward prosperity and strength .
Our Party was deeply aware that , to achieve national rejuven@@ ation , it was imperative to follow the tide of the times , respond to the wishes of the people , and have the courage to reform and open ;
and this awareness created a powerful force for advancing the cause of the Party and the people .
Our Party united the people and led them in launching the great new revolution of reform and opening up , in removing all ideological and institutional barriers to our country and nation ’ s development , and in embar@@ king on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
Thus was China able to str@@ ide ahead to catch up with the times .
Over the past 96 years , to accomplish the historic mission of national rejuven@@ ation , whether in times of weakness or strength , whether in times of ad@@ versity or smooth sailing , our Party has never forgotten its founding mission , nor wa@@ vered in its pursuit .
It has united the people and led them in conqu@@ ering countless challenges , making enormous sacrifices , meeting setbacks squ@@ are@@ ly , and cour@@ age@@ ously righ@@ ting wron@@ gs . Thus we have , time and again , overcome the seemingly insur@@ moun@@ table and created miracle upon miracle .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
Today , we are closer , more confident , and more capable than ever before of making the goal of national rejuven@@ ation a reality .
As the Chinese saying goes , the last leg of a journey marks the halfway point .
Achieving national rejuven@@ ation will be no walk in the park ;
it will take more than drum beating and g@@ ong cl@@ ang@@ ing to get there . Every one of us in the Party must be prepared to work even harder toward this goal .
Re@@ alizing our great dream demands a great struggle .
It is in the movement of contradictions that a society advances ;
where there is contradiction there is struggle .
If our Party is to unite and lead the people to effectively respond to major challenges , withstand major risks , overcome major obstacles , and address major conflicts , it must undertake a great struggle with many new contemporary features .
We will create more channels for rural residents to find employment and increase their incomes .
We will help rural residents seek employment or start businesses in places close to their homes , promote the integrated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries , and expand work-@@ relief programs to ensure that those who return to their homes have a job and income .
We will step up vocational skills training for rural residents .
We will take legal measures to address at the root wage arrears owed to rural migrant workers .
We will support the development of appropriately scaled agricultural operations , and improve commercial services for farmers .
Inten@@ sive processing of farm products will be encouraged .
We will improve support policies for rural land used for industrial development .
We will strengthen collective economies .
We will invest more funds raised through special bonds to support modern agricultural facilities , safe drinking water projects , and the improvement of living environments . This will promote steady improvements in rural living and working conditions .
All thinking and behavior in the vein of pleasure seeking , inaction and slo@@ th , and problem avoidance are unacceptable .
Every one of us in the Party must do more to uphold Party leadership and the Chinese socialist system , and resolutely oppose all statements and actions that undermine , distor@@ t , or neg@@ ate them .
We must do more to protect our people ’ s interests , and firmly oppose all moves that damage their interests or put distance between the Party and the people .
We must do more to channel our energies toward the contemporary current of reform and innovation , and resol@@ ve@@ dly address deep-@@ rooted problems .
We must do more to safeguard China ’ s sovereignty , security , and development interests , and sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly oppose all attempts to split China or undermine its ethnic unity and social harmony and stability .
We must do more to guard against all kinds of risks , and work determin@@ edly to prevail over every political , economic , cultural , social , and natural difficulty and challenge .
Every Party member must fully appreciate the long-term , complex , and on@@ erous nature of this great struggle ; we must be ready to fight , build our ability , and keep striving to secure new vic@@ tories in this great struggle .
Re@@ alizing our great dream demands a great project .
This project is the great new project of Party building that is just getting into full swing .
As history has shown and will continue to bear witness to , without the leadership of the Communist Party of China , national rejuven@@ ation would be just w@@ ish@@ ful thinking .
To remain the van@@ guard of the times , the backbone of the nation , and a Marxist governing party , our Party must always hold itself to the highest standards .
Every Party member must be more actively involved in enhancing Party consciousness , and demonstrate commitment to Party principles .
We must have the courage to face problems squ@@ are@@ ly , be brac@@ ed for the pain , act to remove whatever undermines the Party ’ s purity and advanced nature , and rid ourselves of any virus that ero@@ des the Party ’ s health .
We must keep on strengthening the Party ’ s ability to lead politically , to guide through theory , to organize the people , and to inspire society , thus ensuring that the Party ’ s great vitality and strong ability are forever maintained .
Re@@ alizing our great dream demands a great cause .
Soci@@ alism with Chinese characteristics has been the focus of all of the Party ’ s theories and practice since reform and opening up began .
It is the fundamental achievement of our Party and our people made through countless hardships at enormous cost .
The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only path to socialist modernization and a better life for the people .
The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the right theory to guide the Party and people to realize national rejuven@@ ation .
The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics provides the fundamental institutional guarantee for progress and development in contemporary China . The culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a powerful source of strength that insp@@ ires all members of the Party and the people of all ethnic groups in China .
Our whole Party must strengthen our confidence in the path , theory , system , and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We must neither re@@ trace our steps to the rig@@ idity and isolation of the past , nor take the wrong turn by changing our nature and aband@@ oning our system .
We must maintain our political orientation , do the good solid work that sees our country thrive , and continue to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics .
This great struggle , great project , great cause , and great dream are closely connected , flow seamlessly into each other , and are mutually reinforcing .
Among them , the great new project of Party building plays the decisive role .
All work to advance this project must go hand in hand with that geared toward the struggle , the cause , and the dream .
We must see that as history progres@@ ses and the world under@@ goes profound changes , the Party remains always ahead of the times ;
that as history progres@@ ses and we respond to risks and tests at home and abroad , the Party remains always the backbone of the nation ;
and that as history progres@@ ses and we continue to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics , the Party remains always a powerful leadership core .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
Our mission is a call to action ;
our mission ste@@ ers the course to the future .
We must live up to the trust the people have placed in us and prove ourselves worthy of history ’ s choice .
In the great endeav@@ ors of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era , let us get behind the strong leadership of the Party and engage in a ten@@ acious struggle .
Let all of us , the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , come together , keep going , and create a mighty force that enables us to realize the Chinese Dream .
III . The Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a and the Basic Policy
Since our 18th National Congress , changes both in and outside China , and the progress made in all areas of China ’ s endeav@@ ors , have presented us with a profound question — the question of an era .
Our answer must be a systematic combination of theory and practice and must address what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop , and how we should go about doing it .
This involves fundamental issues like the overarching objectives , tasks , plan , and strategy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era ; like the direction , model , and driving force of development , and the strategic steps , external conditions , and political guarantees .
As well as this , to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics , we should , based on new practice , undertake theoretical analysis and produce policy guidance on the economy , political affairs , rule of law , science and technology , culture , education , the wellbeing of our people , ethnic and religious affairs , social development , ecological conservation , national security , defense and the armed forces , the principle of “ one country , two systems ” and national reunification , the united front , foreign affairs , and Party building .
In answering this question , our Party has been guided by Marx@@ is@@ m-@@ Lenin@@ ism , Mao Z@@ ed@@ ong Th@@ ought , Deng Xia@@ oping Theory , the Theory of Three Represents , and the Scientific Outlook on Development .
It has continued to free our minds , seek truth from facts , move with the times , and apply a realistic and pragmatic approach .
In answering this question , our Party has continued to uphold dialec@@ tical and historical materi@@ alism ; has considered carefully the new conditions of the era and the new requirements of practice ; and has adopted an entirely new perspective to deepen its understanding of the laws that under@@ lie governance by a Communist party , the development of socialism , and the evolution of human society .
It has worked hard to undertake theoretical expl@@ or@@ ations , and has achieved major theoretical innovations , ultimately giving shape to the Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a .
The Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a makes the following things clear :
It makes clear that the overarching goal of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is to realize socialist modernization and national rejuven@@ ation , and , that on the basis of finishing the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects , a two-@@ step approach should be taken to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious , and beautiful by the middle of the century .
It makes clear that the principal contradiction facing Chinese society in the new era is that between un@@ balanced and inadequate development and the people ’ s ever-@@ growing needs for a better life . We must therefore continue commitment to our people-@@ centered philosophy of development , and work to promote well-@@ rounded human development and common prosperity for everyone .
It makes clear that the overall plan for building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the five-@@ sphere integrated plan , and the overall strategy is the four-@@ pr@@ ong@@ ed comprehensive strategy . It highlights the importance of fostering stronger confidence in the path , theory , system , and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
It makes clear that the overall goal of deepening reform in every field is to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China ’ s system and capacity for governance .
It makes clear that the overall goal of comprehensively advancing law@@ -based governance is to establish a system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and build a country of socialist rule of law .
It makes clear that the Party ’ s goal of building a strong military in the new era is to build the people ’ s forces into world-class forces that obey the Party ’ s command , can fight and win , and maintain excellent conduct .
It makes clear that major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics aims to foster a new type of international relations and build a community with a shared future for mankind .
It makes clear that the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China ; the greatest strength of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China ; the Party is the highest force for political leadership . It sets forth the general requirements for Party building in the new era and underlines the importance of political work in Party building .
The Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a builds on and further enrich@@ es Marx@@ is@@ m-@@ Lenin@@ ism , Mao Z@@ ed@@ ong Th@@ ought , Deng Xia@@ oping Theory , the Theory of Three Represents , and the Scientific Outlook on Development .
It represents the latest achievement in adapting Marx@@ ism to the Chinese context and encap@@ su@@ lates the practical experience and collective wisdom of our Party and the people .
It is an important component of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics , and a guide to action for all our members and all the Chinese people as we strive to achieve national rejuven@@ ation . This Th@@ ought must be adhered to and steadily developed on a long-term basis .
Everyone in the Party should develop a good grasp of the essence and rich implications of the Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a and fully and faithfully apply it in all our work .
1 . Ensuring Party leadership over all work
The Party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country .
We must strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity , think in big@@ -@@ picture terms , follow the leadership core , and keep in alignment .
We must work harder to uphold the authority and centralized , unified leadership of the Central Committee , and closely follow the Central Committee in terms of our thinking , political orientation , and actions .
We must improve the institutions and mechanisms for upholding Party leadership , remain committed to the underlying principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability , and ensure coordinated implementation of the five-@@ sphere integrated plan and the four-@@ pr@@ ong@@ ed comprehensive strategy .
We must strengthen the Party ’ s ability and resolve to chart our course , craft overall plans , design policy , and promote reform ; and we must ensure the Party always provides overall leadership and coordinates the efforts of all involved .
2 . Comm@@ itting to a people-@@ centered approach
The people are the cre@@ ators of history ; they are the fundamental force that determines our Party and country ’ s future .
We must ensure the principal status of the people , and adhere to the Party ’ s commitment to serving the public good and exercising power in the interests of the people .
We must observe the Party ’ s fundamental purpose of wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly serving the people , and put into practice the Party ’ s mass line in all aspects of governance .
We must regard as our goal the people ’ s aspirations to live a better life , and rely on the people to move history forward .
3 . Continuing to comprehensively deepen reform
Only with socialism can we save China ; only with reform and opening can we develop China , develop socialism , and develop Marx@@ ism .
We must uphold and improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to modernize China ’ s system and capacity for governance .
We must have the determination to get rid of all outdated thinking and ideas and all institutional ail@@ ments , and to break through the block@@ ades of vested interests .
We should draw on the achievements of other civilizations , develop a set of institutions that are well conceived , fully built , procedure based , and efficiently functioning , and do full justice to the strengths of China ’ s socialist system .
4 . Adop@@ ting a new vision for development
Development is the under@@ pinning and the key for solving all our country ’ s problems ;
our development must be sound development .
We must pursue with firm@@ ness of purpose the vision of innovative , coordinated , green , and open development that is for everyone .
We must uphold and improve China ’ s basic socialist economic system and socialist distribution system . There must be no ir@@ resolution about working to consolidate and develop the public sector ; and there must be no ir@@ resolution about working to encourage , support , and guide the development of the non-@@ public sector .
We must see that the market plays the decisive role in resource allocation , the government plays its role better , and new industrialization , IT application , urbanization , and agricultural modernization go hand in hand .
We must actively participate in and promote economic globalization , develop an open economy of higher standards , and continue to increase China ’ s economic power and composite strength .
5 . Seeing that the people run the country
Commitment to the organic unity of Party leadership , the running of the country by the people , and law@@ -based governance is a natural element of socialist political advancement .
We must keep to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics ; uphold and improve the system of people ’ s congresses , the system of Par@@ ty-@@ led multi@@ party cooperation and political consultation , the system of regional ethnic autonomy , and the system of commun@@ ity-@@ level self-@@ governance ; and consolidate and develop the broadest possible patri@@ otic united front .
We should develop socialist consultative democracy , improve our democratic institutions , diversify our forms of democracy , and establish more democratic channels . We must see to it that the principle of the people running the country is put into practice in China ’ s political and social activities .
6 . Ensuring every dimension of governance is law@@ -based
Law@@ -based governance is an essential requirement and important guarantee for socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We must exercise Party leadership at every point in the process and over every dimension of law@@ -based governance , and be fully committed to promoting socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics .
We must improve the Chinese socialist system of laws , at the heart of which is the Constitution ; establish a Chinese system of socialist rule of law ; build a socialist country based on the rule of law ; and develop Chinese socialist rule of law theory .
We must pursue coordinated progress in law@@ -based governance , law@@ -based exercise of state power , and law@@ -based government administration , and promote the integrated development of rule of law for the country , the government , and society .
We must continue to promote a combination of rule of law and rule of virtue , and combine law@@ -based governance of the country and ru@@ le@@ -based governance over the Party . We must further the reform of the judicial system , and strengthen rule of law awareness among all our people while also enhancing their moral integrity .
7 . U@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding core socialist values
Cultural confidence represents a fundamental and profound force that sus@@ tains the development of a country and a nation .
We must uphold Marx@@ ism , firm up and further build the ideal of Commun@@ ism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics , and nurture and practice core socialist values , while making continued and greater efforts to maintain the initiative and ensure we have our say in the realm of ideology .
We must promote the creative evolution and development of fine traditional Chinese culture , see our revolutionary culture remains alive and strong , and develop an advanced socialist culture .
We should cher@@ ish our cultural roots , draw on other cultures , and be forwar@@ d-@@ thinking .
We should do more to foster a Chinese spirit , Chinese values , and Chinese strength to provide a source of cultural and moral guidance for our people .
8 . Ensuring and improving living standards through development
The wellbeing of the people is the fundamental goal of development .
We must do more to improve the lives and address the concerns of the people , and use development to strengthen areas of weakness and promote social fairness and justice .
We should make steady progress in ensuring people ’ s access to childcare , education , employment , medical services , elderly care , housing , and social assistance .
We will intensify poverty alleviation , see that all our people have a greater sense of fulfillment as they contribute to and gain from development , and continue to promote well-@@ rounded human development and common prosperity for everyone .
We will continue the Peaceful China initiative , strengthen and develop new forms of social governance , and ensure social harmony and stability .
We must work hard to see that our country enjoys enduring peace and stability and our people live and work in conten@@ tment .
9 . Ensuring harmony between human and nature
Building an ecological civilization is vital to sustain the Chinese nation ’ s development .
We must realize that lu@@ cid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and act on this understanding , implement our fundamental national policy of con@@ serving resources and protecting the environment , and cher@@ ish the environment as we cher@@ ish our own lives .
We will adopt a holistic approach to con@@ serving our mountains , rivers , forests , farm@@ lands , lakes , and grass@@ lands , implement the stric@@ test possible systems for environmental protection , and develop eco-@@ friendly growth models and ways of life .
We must pursue a model of sustainable development featuring increased production , higher living standards , and healthy ecosystems .
We must continue the Beautiful China initiative to create good working and living environments for our people and play our part in ensuring global ecological security .
10 . Pursu@@ ing a holistic approach to national security
We should ensure both development and security and be ever ready to protect against potential dangers in time of peace .
This is a major principle underlying the Party ’ s governance .
We must put national interests first , take protecting our people ’ s security as our mission and safeguarding political security as a fundamental task , and ensure both internal and external security , homeland and public security , traditional and non-traditional security , and China ’ s own and common security .
We will improve our systems and institutions and enhance capacity-building for national security , and resolutely safeguard China ’ s sovereignty , security , and development interests .
11 . U@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding absolute Party leadership over the people ’ s armed forces
Building people ’ s forces that obey the Party ’ s command , can fight and win , and maintain excellent conduct is strategically important to achieving the two cen@@ ten@@ ary goals and national rejuven@@ ation .
To realize the Party ’ s goal of building a powerful military in the new era , we must fully implement the fundamental principles and systems of Party leadership over the military , and see that Party strategy on strengthening military capabilities for the new era guides work to build national defense and the armed forces .
We must continue to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces , strengthen them through reform and technology , and run them in accordance with law .
We must place greater focus on combat , encourage innovation , build systems , increase efficacy and efficiency , and further milit@@ ary-@@ civilian integration .
12 . U@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding the principle of “ one country , two systems ” and promoting national reunification
Maintaining lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao and achieving China ’ s full reunification are essential to realizing national rejuven@@ ation .
We must ensure both the central government ’ s overall jurisdiction over the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and a high degree of autonomy in the two regions .
We should ensure that the principle of “ one country , two systems ” remains unchanged , is un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ingly upheld , and in practice is not bent or distorted .
We must uphold the one-@@ China principle and the 1992 Consensus , promote the peaceful development of cross-@@ Straits relations , deepen economic cooperation and cultural exchange between the two sides of the Straits , and encourage fellow Chinese on both sides to oppose all separ@@ atist activities and work together to realize Chinese national rejuven@@ ation .
13 . Promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind
The dream of the Chinese people is closely connected with the dreams of the peoples of other countries ;
the Chinese Dream can be realized only in a peaceful international environment and under a stable international order .
We must keep in mind both our internal and international imper@@ atives , stay on the path of peaceful development , and continue to pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up .
We will uphold justice while pursuing shared interests , and will foster new thinking on common , comprehensive , cooperative , and sustainable security .
We will pursue open , innovative , and inclusive development that benefits everyone ; boost cross-@@ cultural exchanges characterized by harmony within diversity , inclusiveness , and mutual learning ; and cultivate ecosystems based on respect for nature and green development .
China will continue its efforts to safeguard world peace , contribute to global development , and uphold international order .
14 . Exerc@@ ising full and rigorous governance over the Party
To have the courage to carry out self-@@ reform and conduct strict self-@@ governance : this is the most distinctive part of our Party ’ s character .
We must uphold the Party Constitution as our fundamental rules , give top priority to the political work of the Party , combine efforts on ideological work and institution building , and strengthen Party competence in all respects .
We must focus on oversight over the “ key few , ” by which we mean leading officials , and see that the principle of Three S@@ tric@@ ts and Three Ear@@ n@@ ests are observed .
We must uphold democratic centr@@ alism , ensure that intr@@ apar@@ ty political activities are carried out in earnest , impose strict Party discipline , and strengthen internal oversight .
We must develop a positive and healthy political culture in the Party and improve the Party ’ s political ecosystem , resolutely correct misconduct in all its forms , and show zero tolerance for corruption .
We will continue to strengthen the Party ’ s ability to pur@@ ify , improve , and reform itself , and forever maintain its close ties with the people .
The above 14 points form the basic policy that under@@ pins our endeav@@ ors to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era .
All our members must fully implement the Party ’ s basic theory , line , and policy so as to better steer the development of the Party and people ’ s cause .
Just as there are no b@@ ounds to practice , there is no end to theoretical exploration .
The world is changing with every second , every moment ; and China , too , is changing with every second , every moment .
We must ensure our theory evol@@ ves with the times , deepen our appreciation of objective laws , and advance our theoretical , practical , institutional , cultural , and other expl@@ or@@ ations .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
The era is the mother of thought ; practice is the foun@@ t of theory .
If we respond to the call of our times and have the courage to uphold truth and correct errors , the Marx@@ ism of 21st century China will , without a doubt , eman@@ ate more mighty , more compelling power of truth .
IV . Sec@@ uring a Decis@@ ive Victory in Building a Moder@@ ately Pro@@ sper@@ ous Society in All Respec@@ ts and Em@@ bar@@ king on a Journey to Fully Build a Modern Socialist China
After adopting the policy of reform and opening up , our Party laid out three strategic goals for achieving socialist modernization in China .
The first two — ensuring that people ’ s basic needs are met and that their lives are generally decent — have been accomplished ahead of time .
Building on this , our Party then developed the vision that by the time we celebrate our cen@@ ten@@ ary , we will have developed our society into a moder@@ ately prosperous one with a stronger economy , greater democracy , more advanced science and education , thri@@ ving culture , greater social harmony , and a better quality of life .
After this , with another 30 years of work , and by the time we celebrate the cen@@ ten@@ ary of the People ’ s Republic of China , we will have basically achieved modernization and turned China into a modern socialist country .
The period between now and 2020 will be decisive in finishing the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects .
We must follow the requirements on building this society set out at our 16th , 17th , and 18th National Congres@@ ses , act in response to the evolution of the principal contradiction in Chinese society , and promote coordinated economic , political , cultural , social , and ecological advancement .
We must show firm resolve in implementing the strategy for invig@@ or@@ ating China through science and education , the strategy on developing a quality workforce , the innov@@ ation-@@ driven development strategy , the rural vit@@ alization strategy , the coordinated regional development strategy , the sustainable development strategy , and the milit@@ ary-@@ civilian integration strategy .
We must focus on priorities , address in@@ adequ@@ acies , and shore up points of weakness .
In this regard , I want to stress that we must take tough steps to fores@@ tall and def@@ use major risks , carry out targeted poverty alleviation , and prevent and control pollution , so that the moder@@ ately prosperous society we build ear@@ ns the people ’ s approval and stands the test of time .
The period between the 19th and the 20th National Congress is the period in which the time@@ frames of the two cen@@ ten@@ ary goals conver@@ ge .
In this period , not only must we finish building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first cen@@ ten@@ ary goal ;
we must also build on this achievement to embark on a new journey toward the second cen@@ ten@@ ary goal of fully building a modern socialist country .
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the international and domestic environments and the conditions for China ’ s development , we have drawn up a two-@@ stage development plan for the period from 2020 to the middle of this century .
In the first stage from 2020 to 20@@ 35 , we will build on the foundation created by the moder@@ ately prosperous society with a further 15 years of hard work to see that socialist modernization is basically realized .
The vision is that by the end of this stage , the following goals will have been met :
 China ’ s economic and technological strength has increased significantly . China has become a global leader in innovation .
 The rights of the people to participate and to develop as equals are adequately protected . The rule of law for the country , the government , and society is basically in place . Institutions in all fields are further improved ; the modernization of China ’ s system and capacity for governance is basically achieved .
 Social eti@@ quette and civ@@ ility are significantly enhanced . China ’ s cultural soft power has grown much stronger ; Chinese culture has greater appeal .
 People are leading more comfortable lives , and the size of the middle-income group has grown considerably . Dis@@ par@@ ities in urban@@ -@@ rural development , in development between regions , and in living standards are significantly reduced ; equitable access to basic public services is basically ensured ; and solid progress has been made toward prosperity for everyone .
 A modern social governance system has basically taken shape , and society is full of vitality , harmonious , and orderly .
 There is a fundamental improvement in the environment ; the goal of building a Beautiful China is basically attained .
In the second stage from 20@@ 35 to the middle of the 21st century , we will , building on having basically achieved modernization , work hard for a further 15 years and develop China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious , and beautiful .
By the end of this stage , the following goals will have been met :
 New heights are reached in every dimension of material , political , cultural and ethical , social , and ecological advancement .
 Moder@@ ni@@ zation of China ’ s system and capacity for governance is achieved .
 China has become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence .
 Common prosperity for everyone is basically achieved .
 The Chinese people enjoy happier , safer , and healthier lives .
The Chinese nation will become a proud and active member of the community of nations .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
This is our strategic vision for developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era :
Fin@@ ish building a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects , move on to basically realizing modernization , and then turn to making China a great modern socialist country in every dimension .
We must work with resolve and ten@@ acity and strive to write a brilliant chapter on our new journey to socialist modernization .
V. Applying a New Vision of Development and Developing a Moder@@ ni@@ zed Economy
To deliver on the two cen@@ ten@@ ary goals , realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuven@@ ation , and steadily improve our people ’ s lives , we must continue to pursue development as the Party ’ s top priority in governance ;
we must unle@@ ash and develop productive forces , continue reforms to develop the socialist market economy , and promote sustained and sound economic growth .
China ’ s economy has been transi@@ tioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development .
This is a pivotal stage for transforming our growth model , improving our economic structure , and fostering new drivers of growth .
It is imperative that we develop a moderni@@ zed economy . This is both an urgent requirement for getting us smoothly through this critical transition and a strategic goal for China ’ s development .
We must put quality first and give priority to performance .
We should pursue supply-@@ side structural reform as our main task , and work hard for better quality , higher efficiency , and more robust drivers of economic growth through reform .
We need to raise total factor productivity and accelerate the building of an industrial system that promotes coordinated development of the real economy with technological innovation , modern finance , and human resources .
We should endeavor to develop an economy with more effective market mechanisms , dynamic micro-@@ entities , and sound macro-@@ regulation . This will steadily strengthen the innovation capacity and competitiveness of China ’ s economy .
1 . Fur@@ thering supply-@@ side structural reform
In developing a moderni@@ zed economy , we must focus on the real economy , give priority to improving the quality of the supply system , and enhance our economy ’ s strength in terms of quality .
We will work faster to build China into a manufacturer of quality and develop advanced manufacturing , promote further integration of the internet , big data , and artificial intelligence with the real economy , and foster new growth areas and drivers of growth in medium-@@ high end consumption , innov@@ ation-@@ driven development , the green and low-@@ carbon economy , the sharing economy , modern supply chains , and human capital services .
We will support traditional industries in upgrading themselves and accelerate development of modern service industries to elev@@ ate them to international standards .
We will move Chinese industries up to the medium-@@ high end of the global value chain , and foster a number of world-class advanced manufacturing clusters .
We will strengthen infrastructure networks for water conserv@@ ancy , railways , highways , water@@ ways , aviation , pipelines , power gri@@ ds , information , and logistics .

We will inspire and protect entrepreneurship , and encourage more entities to make innovations and start businesses .
We will build an educated , skilled , and innovative workforce , foster respect for model workers , promote quality work@@ manship , and see that taking pride in labor becomes a social norm and seeking excellence is valued as a good work eth@@ ic .
2 . Making China a country of innov@@ ators
Innovation is the primary driving force behind development ; it is the strategic under@@ pinning for building a moderni@@ zed economy .
We should aim for the fron@@ tiers of science and technology , strengthen basic research , and make major break@@ through@@ s in pioneering basic research and ground@@ breaking and original innovations .
We will strengthen basic research in applied sciences , launch major national science and technology projects , and prioritize innovation in key generic technologies , cutting-edge frontier technologies , modern engineering technologies , and disrup@@ tive technologies .
These efforts will provide powerful support for building China ’ s strength in science and technology , product quality , aerospace , cyber@@ space , and transportation ; and for building a digital China and a smart society .
We will improve our national innovation system and boost our strategic scientific and technological strength .
We will further reform the management system for science and technology , and develop a market-@@ oriented system for technological innovation in which enterprises are the main players and synergy is created through the joint efforts of enterprises , universities , and research institutes .
We will support innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises and encourage the application of advances in science and technology . We will foster a culture of innovation , and strengthen the creation , protection , and application of intellectual property .
We should cultivate a large number of world-class scientists and techn@@ ologists in strategically important fields , scientific and technological leaders , and young scientists and engineers , as well as high-@@ performing innovation teams .
3 . Pursu@@ ing a rural vit@@ alization strategy
Issues relating to agriculture , rural areas , and rural people are fundamental to China as they directly concern our country ’ s stability and our people ’ s wellbeing .
Addressing these issues should have a central place on the work agenda of the Party , and we must prioritize the development of agriculture and rural areas .
To build rural areas with thri@@ ving businesses , pleasant living environments , social eti@@ quette and civ@@ ility , effective governance , and prosperity , we need to put in place sound systems , mechanisms , and policies for promoting integrated urban@@ -@@ rural development , and speed up the modernization of agriculture and rural areas .
We will consolidate and improve the basic rural operation system , advance reform of the rural land system , and improve the system for separating the ownership rights , contract rights , and management rights for contracted rural land .
Rural land contracting practices will remain stable and unchanged on a long-term basis ; the current round of contracts will be extended for another 30 years upon expiration .
We will press ahead with reform of the rural collective property rights system , safeguard the property rights and interests of rural people , and strengthen the collective economy .
We must ensure China ’ s food security so that we always have control over our own food supply .
We will establish industrial , production , and business operation systems for modern agriculture , and improve the systems for supporting and protecting agriculture .

We will strengthen basic services in rural communities , and improve the rural governance model which combines self-@@ governance , rule of law , and rule of virtue .
We will train professional rural service personnel who have a good knowledge of agriculture , love our rural areas , and care about rural people .
4 . Implementing the coordinated regional development strategy
We will devote more energy to speeding up the development of old revolutionary base areas , areas with large ethnic minority populations , border areas , and poor areas .
We will strengthen measures to reach a new stage in the large-scale development of the western region ; deepen reform to accelerate the revitalization of old industrial bases in the northeast and other parts of the country ; help the central region rise by tapping into local strengths ; and support the eastern region in taking the lead in pursuing optimal development through innovation .
To this end , we need to put in place new , effective mechanisms to ensure coordinated development of different regions .
We will create networks of cities and towns based on city clusters , enabling the coordinated development of cities of different sizes and small towns , and speed up work on granting permanent urban residency to people who move from rural to urban areas .
We will relieve Beijing of functions non@@ essential to its role as the capital and use this effort to drive the coordinated development of the Beij@@ ing-@@ Ti@@ anj@@ in-@@ Hebei region ; and we will develop forward-looking plans and adopt high standards for building the Xi@@ ong@@ an New Area .
We will facilitate the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt by promoting well-@@ coordinated environmental conservation and avoiding excessive development .
Support will be given to resource-@@ depleted areas in their economic transformation .
We will accelerate development in the border areas , and ensure their stability and security .
We will pursue coordinated land and marine development , and step up efforts to build China into a strong maritime country .
5 . Accel@@ erating efforts to improve the socialist market economy
In our economic reforms , we must concentrate on improving the property rights system and ensuring the marke@@ t-based allocation of factors of production , so that property rights act as effective incentives .
We should ensure free flows of factors , flexible prices , fair and orderly competition , and that business survival is determined by competition .
We will improve the systems for managing different types of state assets , and reform the system of authorized operation of state capital .
In the state-owned sector , we will step up improved distribution , structural adjustment , and strategic reorganization .
We will work to see that state assets maintain and increase their value ; we will support state capital in becoming stronger , doing better , and growing bigger , and take effective measures to prevent the loss of state assets .
We will further reform of state-owned enterprises , develop mix@@ ed-@@ ownership economic entities , and turn Chinese enterprises into world-class , globally competitive firms .
We will introduce a negative list for market access nationwide , sort through and do away with regulations and practices that impede the development of a unified market and fair competition , support the growth of private businesses , and stimulate the vitality of various market entities .
We will deepen reforms in the business sector , break administrative monopol@@ ies , preclude the forming of market monopol@@ ies , speed up the reform of marke@@ t-based pricing of factors of production , relax control over market access in the service sector , and improve market oversight mechanisms .
We will develop new methods to improve macro-@@ regulation , give full play to the strategic guidance of national development plans , and improve mechanisms for coordinating fiscal , monetary , industrial , regional , and other economic policies .

We will improve the framework of regulation under@@ pinned by monetary policy and macro-@@ prud@@ ential policy , and see that interest rates and exchange rates become more marke@@ t-based .
We will improve the financial regulatory system to fores@@ tall systemic financial risks .
6 . Making new ground in pursuing opening up on all fronts
Open@@ ness brings progress , while self-@@ sec@@ lu@@ sion leaves one behind .
China will not close its door to the world ; we will only become more and more open .
We should pursue the Belt and Road Initiative as a priority , give equal emphasis to " bringing in " and “ going global , ” follow the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration , and increase openness and cooperation in building innovation capacity .
With these efforts , we hope to make new ground in opening China further through links running eas@@ tward and wes@@ tward , across land and over sea .
We will expand foreign trade , develop new models and new forms of trade , and turn China into a trader of quality .
We will adopt policies to promote high-@@ standard liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment ;
we will implement the system of pre-@@ establishment national treatment plus a negative list across the board , significantly ease market access , further open the service sector , and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors .
All businesses registered in China will be treated equally .
We will improve the balance in opening our different regions , and open the western region wider .
We will grant more powers to pilot free trade zones to conduct reform , and explore the opening of free trade ports .
We will develop new ways of making out@@ bound investments , promote international cooperation on production capacity , form glob@@ ally-@@ oriented networks of trade , investment and financing , production , and services , and build up our strengths for international economic cooperation and competition .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
Un@@ locking and developing the productive forces is a fundamental task of socialism . We must inspire creativity and vitality throughout society , and strive to achieve better quality , more efficient , fai@@ rer , and more sustainable development .
VI . Improving the System of Institutions through Which the People Run the Country and Developing Socialist Democracy
China is a socialist country of people ’ s democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working class based on an alliance of workers and farmers ;
it is a country where all power of the state belongs to the people .
China ’ s socialist democracy is the broadest , most genuine , and most effective democracy to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people .
The very purpose of developing socialist democracy is to give full expression to the will of the people , protect their rights and interests , spark their creativity , and provide systemic and institutional guarantees to ensure the people run the country .
The path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics is the logical outcome of the evolution of history , theory , and practice as the Chinese people have long engaged in struggles since the advent of modern times .
It is a requisite for maintaining the very nature of the Party and fulfilling its fundamental purpose .
No two political systems are entirely the same , and a political system cannot be judged in abstr@@ action without regard for its social and political context , its history , and its cultural traditions .
No one political system should be regarded as the only choice ; and we should not just mechan@@ ically copy the political systems of other countries .
We must uphold long term and steadily strengthen China ’ s socialist democracy , make active and prudent efforts to advance the reform of the political system , and improve the institutions , standards , and procedures of socialist democracy .
We should ensure that people participate , in accordance with law and in various ways and forms , in the management of state , economic , cultural , and social affairs , and consolidate and enhance political stability , unity , and vitality .
1 . U@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding the unity of Party leadership , the running of the country by the people , and law@@ -based governance
Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring that the people run the country and governance in China is law@@ -based ; that the people run the country is an essential feature of socialist democracy ; and law@@ -based governance is the basic way for the Party to lead the people in governing the country . These three elements are integral components of socialist democracy .
In China ’ s political life , our Party exercises leadership . Strengthening the centralized , unified leadership of the Party on the one hand and , on the other , supporting the people ’ s congresses , governments , committees of the Chinese People ’ s Political Consultative Conference ( CP@@ PC@@ C ) , courts , and procur@@ ator@@ ates in performing their functions and playing their roles in accordance with the law and their char@@ ters , form a unified pair .
We will improve the way the Party exercises leadership and governance to ensure that it leads the people in effectively governing the country . We will expand the people ’ s orderly political participation to see that in accordance with law they engage in democratic elections , consultations , decision-making , management , and oversight .
We should uphold the unity , sanc@@ ti@@ ty , and authority of China ’ s legal system , and strengthen legal protection for human rights to ensure that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedoms as prescribed by law .
We should both consolidate government and improve the institutions of democracy at the primary level to ensure the people ’ s rights to be informed , to participate , to be heard , and to oversee .
We will improve mechanisms for law@@ -based decision-making , and put in place mechanisms for the exercise of power that ensure sound decision-making , resolute execution , and effective oversight .
Officials at all levels must deepen their understanding of democracy , be democratic in their conduct , willingly accept public oversight , and perform as they should in their role as public servants .
2 . Strengthening institutional guarantees to ensure the people run the country
We must uphold long term and steadily improve the system of people ’ s congresses , a political system fundamental to the Party ’ s leadership , the running of the country by the people , and law@@ -based governance .
We should support and ensure the people ’ s exercise of state power through people ’ s congresses .
We should see to it that people ’ s congresses and their standing committees play the leading role in law@@ making , and improve the organizational and working systems of people ’ s congresses to support and ensure the exercise of their statutory powers of enacting laws , conducting oversight , making decisions , and appointing and removing officials .
We should give better play to the role of deputies to people ’ s congresses , and enable people ’ s congresses at all levels and their standing committees to fully perform their functions as stipulated in the Constitution and the law , and to truly represent the people and maintain close ties with them .
We should improve the setup of special committees of people ’ s congresses and the composition of their standing committees and special committees .
3 . Giving play to the important role of socialist consultative democracy
The essence of the people ’ s democracy is that the people get to discuss their own affairs . Consultative democracy is an important way of effec@@ ting Party leadership and a model and strength unique to China ’ s socialist democracy .
We will advance extensive , multi@@ level , and institutionalized development of consultative democracy , and adopt a coordinated approach to promoting consultations carried out by political parties , people ’ s congresses , government departments , CP@@ PC@@ C committees , people ’ s organizations , communities , and social organizations .
We will strengthen the institutions of consultative democracy and develop complete procedures and practices to enable the people ’ s broad , continuous , and intensive participation in day-to-day political activities .
The CP@@ PC@@ C , as a distinc@@ tively Chinese political institution , is a major channel for socialist consultative democracy , and its committees are specialist consultative bodies . The CP@@ PC@@ C committees should focus on the Party and the country ’ s key tasks .
With the themes of unity and democracy in mind , they should exercise consultative democracy throughout the whole process of political consultation , democratic oversight , and participation in the deliberation and administration of state affairs ; and they should improve the content and forms of consultation and deliberation to build consensus and promote unity .
They should strengthen democratic oversight , focusing on the implementation of the major principles , policies , decisions , and plans of the Party and the state . They should better represent the different social sectors and strengthen the competence of their members .
4 . Adv@@ ancing law@@ -based governance
Adv@@ ancing law@@ -based governance in all fields is a profound revolution in China ’ s governance .
We must promote the rule of law and work to ensure sound law@@ making , strict law enforcement , impartial administration of justice , and the observance of law by everyone .
A central leading group for advancing law@@ -based governance in all areas will be set up to exercise unified leadership over the initiative to build rule of law in China .
We will strengthen oversight to ensure compliance with the Constitution , advance constitu@@ tionality review , and safeguard the authority of the Constitution .
We will carry out law@@ making in a well-@@ conceived and democratic way and in accordance with law , so that good laws are made to promote development and ensure good governance .
We will build a rule of law government , promote law@@ -based government administration , and see that law is enforced in a strict , proce@@ du@@ re@@ -based , impartial , and non-@@ abusive way .
We will carry out comprehensive and integrated reform of the judicial system and enforce judicial accountability in all respects , so that the people can see in every judicial case that justice is served .
We will redouble efforts to raise public awareness of the law , develop a socialist culture of rule of law , and increase public awareness of the principle underlying rule of law that the Constitution and the law are above everything else and that everyone is equal before the law .
Every Party organization and every Party member must take the lead in respecting , learning about , observing , and applying the law .
No organization or individual has the power to over@@ step the Constitution or the law ; and no one is allowed in any way to over@@ ride the law with his or her own orders , place his or her authority above the law , violate the law for personal gain , or abuse the law .
5 . De@@ ep@@ ening reform of Party and government institutions and the system of government administration
We will adopt a comprehensive approach to the setup of Party and government institutions , and ensure that powers are designated properly and functions and duties are defined clearly both for the institutions themselves and their internal bodies .
We will use various types of staffing resources in a coordinated way , develop a sound system of administration , and improve the organic law for state institutions .
The government needs to transform its functions , further streamline administration and delegate powers , develop new ways of regulation and supervision , and strengthen its credibility and administrative capacity , building itself into a service-@@ oriented government able to satisfy the needs of the people .
More decision making power should be given to governments at and below the provincial level , and ways should be explored to merge Party and government bodies with similar functions at the provincial , prefec@@ tural , and county levels or for them to work together as one office while keeping separate identities .
We will deepen the reform of public institutions to see that they focus on serving public interests , relieve them of government functions , keep them away from business activities , and let them run their own day-to-day operations while maintaining supervision over them .
6 . Consolid@@ ating and developing the patri@@ otic united front
The united front is an important way to ensure the success of the Party ’ s cause , and we must maintain commitment to it long term .
We must uphold the banner of patri@@ o@@ tism and socialism , strive to achieve great unity and solidarity , balance common@@ ality and diversity , and expand common ground and the convergence of interests .
In handling its relationships with other Chinese political parties , the Communist Party of China is guided by the principles of long-term coexistence , mutual oversight , sincerity , and sharing the rough times and the smooth , and it supports these parties in performing their duties in accordance with the requirements of the Chinese socialist system for their participation in governance .
We will fully implement the Party ’ s policies concerning ethnic groups , heigh@@ ten public awareness of ethnic unity and progress , and create a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation .
We will encourage more exchanges and interactions among different ethnic groups , helping them remain closely united like the seeds of a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate that stick together , and work jointly for common prosperity and development .
We will fully implement the Party ’ s basic policy on religious affairs , uphold the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to socialist society .
We will encourage intellectu@@ als who are not Party members and people belonging to new social groups to play the important roles they have in building socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We should form a new type of cor@@ dial and clean relationship between government and business , promote healthy growth of the non-@@ public sector of the economy , and encourage those working in this sector to achieve success .
We will maintain extensive contacts with overseas Chinese nationals , returned Chinese and their relatives and unite them so that they can join our endeav@@ ors to revitalize the Chinese nation .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
The political system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a great creation of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people .
We have every confidence that we can give full play to the strengths and distinctive features of China ’ s socialist democracy , and make China ’ s contribution to the political advancement of mankind .
VII . Building Strong@@ er Cultural Confid@@ ence and Hel@@ ping Socialist Culture to Fl@@ our@@ ish
Culture is a country and nation ’ s soul . Our country will thrive only if our culture thri@@ ves , and our nation will be strong only if our culture is strong .
Without full confidence in our culture , without a rich and prosperous culture , the Chinese nation will not be able to rejuven@@ ate itself .
We must develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , inspire the cultural creativity of our whole nation , and develop a great socialist culture in China .
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is derived from China ’ s fine traditional culture , which was born of the Chinese civilization and nur@@ tured over more than 5,000 years ; it has grown out of the revolutionary and advanced socialist culture that developed over the course of the Chinese people ’ s revolution , construction , and reform under the Party ’ s leadership ; and it is rooted in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
To develop socialist culture with Chinese characteristics means to develop a socialist culture for our nation — a culture that is sound and people-@@ oriented , that embr@@ aces modernization , the world , and the future , and that both promotes socialist material wellbeing and raises socialist cul@@ tur@@ al-@@ ethical standards . In developing this culture , we must follow the guidance of Marx@@ ism , base our efforts on Chinese culture , and take into account the realities of contemporary China and the conditions of the present era .
We should ensure that this culture serves the people and serves socialism . We should follow the principle of letting a hundred flowers bl@@ oom and a hundred schools of thought con@@ tend , and encourage creative transformation and development , so as to add new l@@ uster to Chinese culture .
1 . Holding firmly the leading position in ideological work
Ide@@ ology determines the direction a culture should take and the path it should follow as it develops .
We must continue to adapt Marx@@ ism to China ’ s conditions , keep it up-to-date , and enhance its popular appeal .
We will develop socialist ideology that has the ability to unite and the power to inspire the people to embrace shared ideals , convictions , values , and moral standards .
We will better arm ourselves with theory and increase the public appeal of the Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a .
We will work harder to study and develop Marxist theory , work faster to develop philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics , and develop new types of think tanks with distinctive Chinese features .
We will maintain the right tone in public communication , give priority to improving means of communication and to creating new ones , and strengthen the penetration , guidance , influence , and credibility of the media .
We will provide more and better online content and put in place a system for integrated internet management to ensure a clean cyber@@ space .
We will implement the system of responsibility for ideological work , and further consolidate our positions and improve management in this field . We will distinguish between matters of political principle , issues of understanding and thinking , and academic view@@ points , but we must oppose and resist various erron@@ eous views with a clear stand .
2 . Cul@@ tiv@@ ating and observing core socialist values
Core socialist values represent the contemporary Chinese spirit and are a cryst@@ alli@@ zation of the values shared by all Chinese people .
We will focus on fostering a new generation capable of shoul@@ dering the mission of national rejuven@@ ation ; we will offer them better guidance , expose them to practice , and provide institutional guarantees .
We will draw on core socialist values to guide education , efforts to raise cul@@ tur@@ al-@@ ethical standards , and the creation , production , and distribution of cultural and intellectual products , and see that all areas of social development are im@@ bu@@ ed with these values and that they become part of people ’ s thinking and behavior .
To this end , we will encourage extensive public involvement , making our officials take the lead and starting with families and children .
We will draw on China ’ s fine traditional culture , keep alive and develop its vision , concepts , values , and moral norms , and do so in a way that responds to the call of our era . With this we will see that Chinese culture maintains its appeal and evol@@ ves with the times .
3 . Ra@@ ising intellectual and moral standards
When the people have ideals , their country will have strength , and their nation will have a bright future . We will help our people raise their political awareness and moral standards , foster appreciation of fine culture , and enhance social eti@@ quette and civ@@ ility .
We will undertake extensive public awareness activities to help the people develop firm ideals and convictions , build their awareness of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Chinese Dream , foster a Chinese eth@@ os and a readiness to respond to the call of our times , strengthen the guiding role of patri@@ o@@ tism , collec@@ ti@@ vism , and socialism , and see that the people develop an accurate understanding of history , ethnicity , country , and culture .
We will launch a civic morality campaign to raise public ethical standards , and enhance work ethics , family virtu@@ es , and personal integrity .
We will encourage our people to strive for excellence and to develop stronger virtu@@ es , respect the elderly , love families , and be loyal to the country and the people .
We will improve and strengthen our ideological and political work , and launch initiatives to raise the public ’ s cul@@ tur@@ al-@@ ethical standards .
We will promote the spirit of science and make scientific knowledge widely attainable ; we will work to see the back of outdated social mo@@ res and to promote good and up-to-date practices and trends ; and we will resist the corro@@ sive influence of backward and dec@@ ad@@ ent culture .
We will promote credibility building , institution@@ alize volunteer services , and heigh@@ ten people ’ s sense of social responsibility , awareness of rules , and sense of dedication .
4 . Seeing socialist literature and art thrive

We have reached a new historical starting point in strengthening national defense and the armed forces .
Con@@ fron@@ ted with profound changes in our national security environment and responding to the demands of the day for a strong country with a strong military , we must fully implement the Party ’ s thinking on strengthening the military for the new era and the military strategy for new conditions , build a powerful and moderni@@ zed army , navy , air force , rocket force , and strategic support force , develop strong and efficient joint operations commanding institutions for theater commands , and create a modern combat system with distinctive Chinese characteristics .
Our armed forces must be up to shoul@@ dering the missions and tasks of the new era entrusted to them by the Party and the people .
We will adapt to the trend of a new global military revolution and to national security needs ; we will upgrade our military capabilities , and see that , by the year 2020 , mechan@@ ization is basically achieved , IT application has come a long way , and strategic capabilities have seen a big improvement . In step with our country ’ s modernization process , we will modernize our military across the board in terms of theory , organizational structure , service personnel , and weapon@@ ry .
We will make it our mission to see that by 20@@ 35 , the modernization of our national defense and our forces is basically completed ; and that by the mid-@@ 21st century our people ’ s armed forces have been fully transformed into world-class forces .
We will strengthen Party building in the military .
We will launch activities under the theme of “ passing on the traditions of revolution ; stepping up to the task of making the military strong . ” We will move forward with the development of the military hon@@ ors system .
We will train the revolutionary officers and soldiers of a new era with faith , ability , courage , and integrity , and see that our forces forever preserve their nature , purpose , and character as the forces of the people . We will continue to deepen national defense and military reform .

We will govern the military with strict discipline in every respect , push for a fundamental transformation in the way our military is run , and strengthen the role of rule of law in enhancing national defense and military capabilities .
A military is built to fight . Our military must regard combat capability as the criterion to meet in all its work and focus on how to win when it is called on .
We will take solid steps to ensure military preparedness for all strategic directions , and make progress in combat readiness in both traditional and new security fields .
We will develop new combat forces and support forces , conduct military training under combat conditions , strengthen the application of military strength , speed up development of intelligent military , and improve combat capabilities for joint operations based on the network information system and the ability to fight under multi-@@ dimensional conditions .

XI . U@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding “ One Country , Two Systems ” and Moving toward National Re@@ unification
Since Hong Kong and Macao ’ s return to the motherland , the practice of “ one country , two systems ” in both regions has been a res@@ ounding success .
The policy of “ one country , two systems ” has proved to be the best solution to the questions of Hong Kong and Macao , left by history , and the best institutional guarantee for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao after their return .
To maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao , it is imperative to fully and faithfully implement the policies of “ one country , two systems , ” “ the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong , ” “ the people of Macao governing Macao , ” and a high degree of autonomy for both regions . It is imperative too , to act in strict compliance with China ’ s Constitution and the basic laws of the two special administrative regions , and to improve the systems and mechanisms for enforcing the basic laws .
We will continue to support the governments and chief executives of both regions in pursuing the following endeav@@ ors : exercising law@@ -based governance , uni@@ ting and leading the people of all sectors in an active and concerted effort to promote development and harmony , ensuring and improving people ’ s wellbeing , taking well-@@ ordered steps to advance democracy , maintaining law and order , and fulfilling the constitutional responsibility of safeguarding China ’ s sovereignty , security , and development interests .
The development of Hong Kong and Macao is closely tied up with that of the mainland . We will continue to support Hong Kong and Macao in integrating their own development into the overall development of the country . We will give priority to the development of the Guang@@ d@@ ong-@@ Hong K@@ ong-@@ Macao Greater Bay Area , cooperation between Guangdong , Hong Kong , and Macao , and regional cooperation in the pan@@ -@@ Pearl River Delta , thus fully advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between the mainland and the two regions .
We will formulate and improve policies and measures to make it more convenient for people from Hong Kong and Macao to develop careers on the mainland .
We will remain committed to the policy for the Hong Kong people to govern Hong Kong and the Macao people to govern Macao , with patri@@ ots playing the principal role . We will develop and strengthen the ranks of patri@@ ots who love both our country and their regions , and foster greater patri@@ o@@ tism and a stronger sense of national identity among the people in Hong Kong and Macao . With this , our com@@ patri@@ ots in Hong Kong and Macao will share both the historic responsibility of national rejuven@@ ation and the pride of a strong and prosperous China .
Res@@ ol@@ ving the Taiwan question to realize China ’ s complete reunification is the shared aspiration of all Chinese people , and is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation . We must uphold the principles of “ peaceful reunification ” and “ one country , two systems , ” work for the peaceful development of cross-@@ Straits relations , and advance the process toward the peaceful reunification of China .
The one-@@ China principle is the political foundation of cross-@@ Straits relations . The 1992 Consensus em@@ bodies the one-@@ China principle and defines the fundamental nature of cross-@@ Straits relations ; it thus holds the key to the peaceful development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .
Recogni@@ ze the historical fact of the 1992 Consensus and that the two sides both belong to one China , and then our two sides can conduct dialogue to address through discussion the concerns of the people of both sides , and no political party or group in Taiwan will have any difficulty conducting exchanges with the mainland .
Blood is thick@@ er than water . People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are brothers and sisters ;
we share the bond of kin@@ ship . Guided by the conviction that we are all of the same family , we respect the current social system and way of life in Taiwan and are ready to share the development opportunities on the mainland with our Taiwan com@@ patri@@ ots first .
We will expand cross-@@ Straits economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefits . We will ensure that over time , people from Taiwan will enjoy the same treatment as local people when they pursue their studies , start businesses , seek jobs , or live on the mainland , thus improving the wellbeing of Taiwan com@@ patri@@ ots . We will encourage people from both sides to work together to promote Chinese culture and forge closer bonds between them .
We stand firm in safeguarding China ’ s sovereignty and territorial integrity , and will never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself .
Any separ@@ atist activity is certain to meet with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people . We have the resolve , the confidence , and the ability to defeat separ@@ atist attempts for “ Taiwan independence ” in any form .
We will never allow anyone , any organization , or any political party , at any time or in any form , to separate any part of Chinese territory from China !
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
Re@@ alizing the rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation is a dream shared by all of us as Chinese .
We remain firm in our conviction that , as long as all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , including our com@@ patri@@ ots in Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan , follow the tide of history , work together for the greater national interests , and keep our nation ’ s destiny firmly in our own hands , we will , without doubt , be able to achieve the great rejuven@@ ation of the Chinese nation .

As human beings we have many common challenges to face .
Our world is full of both hope and challenges . We should not give up on our dreams because the reality around us is too complicated ; we should not stop pursuing our ideals because they seem out of our reach . No country can address alone the many challenges facing mankind ; no country can afford to retreat into self-@@ isolation .
We call on the people of all countries to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind , to build an open , inclusive , clean , and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace , universal security , and common prosperity .
We should respect each other , discuss issues as equals , resolutely reject the Cold War mentality and power politics , and take a new approach to developing state@@ -to-@@ state relations with communication , not confrontation , and with partnership , not alliance .

We should stick together through thick and thin , promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation , and make economic globalization more open , inclusive , and balanced so that its benefits are shared by all .
We should respect the diversity of civilizations . In handling relations among civilizations , let us replace es@@ tr@@ ang@@ ement with exchange , clashes with mutual learning , and superiority with coexistence .
We should be good friends to the environment , cooperate to tackle climate change , and protect our planet for the sake of human survival .
China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace . We respect the right of the people of all countries to choose their own development path .
We endeavor to uphold international fairness and justice , and oppose acts that impose one ’ s will on others or interfere in the internal affairs of others as well as the practice of the strong bul@@ lying the weak .
China will never pursue development at the expense of others ’ interests , but nor will China ever give up its legitimate rights and interests .
No one should expect us to swallow anything that undermines our interests .
China pursu@@ es a national defense policy that is in nature defensive .
China ’ s development does not pose a threat to any other country .
No matter what stage of development it reaches , China will never seek hegem@@ ony or engage in expansion .
China has actively developed global partnerships and expanded the convergence of interests with other countries .
China will promote coordination and cooperation with other major countries and work to build a framework for major country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development .
China will deepen relations with its neighbors in accordance with the principle of am@@ ity , sincerity , mutual benefit , and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendship and partnership with its neighbors .
China will , guided by the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests and the principle of sincerity , real results , aff@@ inity , and good faith , work to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries .
We will strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the political parties and organizations of other countries , and encourage people ’ s congresses , CP@@ PC@@ C committees , the military , local governments , and people ’ s organizations to engage in exchanges with other countries .
China adhe@@ res to the fundamental national policy of opening up and pursu@@ es development with its doors open wide .
China will actively promote international cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative .
In doing so , we hope to achieve policy , infrastructure , trade , financial , and people@@ -to-@@ people connectivity and thus build a new platform for international cooperation to create new drivers of shared development .
China will increase assistance to other developing countries , especially the least developed countries , and do its part to reduce the North-South development gap .
China will support multilateral trade regimes and work to facilitate the establishment of free trade areas and build an open world economy .
China follows the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in engaging in global governance . China stands for democracy in international relations and the equality of all countries , big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor .
China supports the United Nations in playing an active role in international affairs , and supports the efforts of other developing countries to increase their representation and strengthen their voice in international affairs .
China will continue to play its part as a major and responsible country , take an active part in reforming and developing the global governance system , and keep contributing Chinese wisdom and strength to global governance .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
The future of the world rests in the hands of the people of all countries ; the future of mankind h@@ inges on the choices they make .
We , the Chinese , are ready to work with the people of all other countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind and create a bright tomorrow for all of us .
XIII . Exerc@@ ising Str@@ ict Governance over the Party and Improving the Party ’ s A@@ bility to G@@ overn and Lead
As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era , our Party must get a new look and make new accomplishments .
As the saying goes , it takes a good black@@ smith to make good steel .
For the Party to unite the people and lead them in carrying out our great struggle , advancing our great cause , and realizing our great dream , we must un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ingly uphold and improve Party leadership and make the Party still stronger .
Ensuring Party self-@@ governance is exercised fully and strictly is a journey to which there ’ s no end .
The future of a political party or a government is determined by whether it enjoys public support .
We must guard against and correct with resolve the practices the people oppose and res@@ ent .
The whole Party must be so@@ ber@@ ly aware that the governance environment our Party faces is complex , and that so too are the factors undermining the Party ’ s advanced nature and purity ; prominent problems of imp@@ urity in thinking , organization , and conduct in the Party have not been solved root and branch .
We must fully recognize the long-term and complex nature of the tests confronting the Party as they relate to governance , reform and opening up , the market economy , and the external environment .
We must also fully recognize the intensity and severity of the dangers of a lack of drive , in@@ competence , dis@@ engagement from the people , inaction , and corruption . So we must focus on solving problems , maintain strategic resolve , and ensure strict Party self-@@ governance .
The general requirements for Party building for the new era are :
 U@@ ph@@ old and strengthen overall Party leadership and ensure that the Party exercises effective self-@@ supervision and practices strict self-@@ governance in every respect ;
 Take strengthening the Party ’ s long-term governance capacity and its advanced nature and purity as the main thrust ; take enhancing the Party ’ s political building as the overarching principle ; take holding dear the Party ’ s ideals , convictions , and purpose as the under@@ pinning ; and take harn@@ essing the whole Party ’ s enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity as the focus of efforts ;
 Make all-round efforts to see the Party ’ s political building enhanced , its theory strengthened , its organizations consolidated , its conduct improved , and its discipline enforced , with institution building incorporated into every aspect of Party building ;
 Step up efforts to combat corruption and continue to improve the efficacy of Party building ;
 Build the Party into a vibrant Marxist governing party that is always at the forefront of the times , enjoys the wh@@ ole@@ hearted support of the people , has the courage to reform itself , and is able to withstand all tests .
1 . P@@ utting the Party ’ s political building first
Taking a clear political stand is the fundamental requirement our Party must meet as a Marxist party .
The Party ’ s political building is of fundamental importance to the Party as it determines the direction and efficacy of Party building .
The primary task of political Party building is to ensure that the whole Party obe@@ ys the Central Committee and up@@ holds its authority and centralized , unified leadership .
All Party members must closely follow the Party ’ s political line , strictly observe its political discipline and rules , and closely align themselves with the Central Committee in terms of political stance , direction , principle , and path .
Every member of the Party must hold the Party Constitution in great reve@@ rence , act in strict accordance with the code of conduct for intr@@ apar@@ ty political life under new circumstances , and make intr@@ apar@@ ty activities more politically oriented , up-to-date , principled , and effective .
We must guard against the rules of business dealings ero@@ ding intr@@ apar@@ ty conduct , and foster a healthy political atmosphere of integrity within the Party .
We must improve and implement the systems of democratic centr@@ alism , and practice both democr@@ ac@@ y-based centr@@ alism and centr@@ al@@ is@@ m-@@ guided democracy .
This means we should both give full play to democracy and practice centr@@ alism on this basis .
We must foster values like loyalty , honesty , impartiality , adherence to fact , and integrity ; guard against and oppose self-@@ centered behavior , decentr@@ alism , behavior in disregard of the rules , a sil@@ o mentality , un@@ principled nic@@ e-@@ gu@@ y@@ ism , and sec@@ tari@@ anism , fac@@ tion@@ alism , and patron@@ age .
We must resolutely oppose double-@@ dealing and dupl@@ icity .
All Party members , especially high-ranking officials , must strengthen their Party consciousness , political awareness , and political ability .
We must regard it as our fundamental political responsibility to be loyal to the Party , share the Party ’ s concerns , fulfill our obligations to the Party , and work for the people ’ s wellbeing , and forever preserve the political character of Commun@@ ists .
2 . Ar@@ ming the whole Party with the Th@@ ought on Soci@@ alism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Er@@ a
Theory is fundamental to Party building .
Our revolutionary ideals so@@ ar beyond the sk@@ ies . The noble ideal of Commun@@ ism and the shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics are our source of strength and political soul as Chinese Commun@@ ists ; they also form the theoretical foundation of Party solidarity and unity .
Our top priority in building the Party through theory is to stay true to our ideals and convictions .
We should make all Party members keep firmly in mind the Party ’ s purpose , have un@@ wavering convictions as Commun@@ ists , resolve the fundamental issue of the world@@ view , outlook on life , and values we should embrace , and maintain deep belief in and faithfully practice Commun@@ ism and socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We will foster a Marxist style of learning , and make it regular practice and an institutionalized requirement for all Party members to gain a good command of the Party Constitution , Party regulations , and related major policy addresses and to meet Party standards .
We will launch a campaign on the theme of “ staying true to our founding mission ” to enable all Party members , especially officials at and above the county and director level , to arm themselves with the Party ’ s new theories and become more purpos@@ eful in working ti@@ relessly to accomplish the Party ’ s historic mission in the new era .
3 . Training a contingent of competent and professional officials
Party officials are a central pillar of strength for the cause of our Party and country .
We must adhere to the principle of the Party supervising officials ; select officials on the basis of both integrity and ability , with priority given to integrity , and on the basis of merit regardless of background ; and ensure that those who are dedicated , impartial , and upright should be appointed .
We must implement in earnest the criteria for evaluating good officials . In selecting and appointing officials , we must adopt the right approach , with emphasis on political performance .
We will promote and put in important positions those Party officials who do well according to the following criteria : they maintain political integrity , think in terms of the big picture , follow the leadership core , and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership ; they have full confidence in the path , theory , system , and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics ; they uphold the authority of the Central Committee and faithfully follow the Party ’ s theories , lines , principles , and policies ; and they are loyal to the Party , have moral integrity , and demonstrate a keen sense of responsibility . We will strengthen leadership teams at all levels by appointing competent officials .
We will take seriously the development of specialized expertise and professionalism , and enhance Party officials ’ ability to meet the requirements of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era .
We will work harder to identify promising young officials and get them well prepared for future jobs .
We will focus on their practical training in local communities , in work on the fron@@ tline , and in areas where conditions are harsh , and work to produce a constant stream of outstanding young officials who have passed the test of practice . We will ensure coordinated training and selection of female officials , officials from ethnic minorities , and non-@@ Party officials . We will ensure that retired officials are well taken care of .
We will be both strict and caring , and place equal emphasis on providing incentives and imposing constraints .
We will improve the performance assessment and evaluation system for officials , institute incentive mechanisms and mechanisms to allow for and address errors , and take a clear stand in supporting officials who are willing to assume responsibility , who take a down@@ -to-@@ earth approach in their work , and who do not seek personal gain . Party organizations at every level should care about officials working at the primary level , and help solve the problems and difficulties they encounter .
People with talent are a strategic resource for China as it endeav@@ ors to achieve national rejuven@@ ation and stay ahead in international competition .
We must follow the principle of the Party exercising leadership over personnel , assemble the best minds across the land and draw fully on their expertise , and step up efforts to make China a tal@@ ent-@@ strong country .
We will pursue a more proactive , open , and effective policy on training competent professionals .
We should value people with talent , be good at identifying talent , have the fore@@ sight to employ them , be earnest to keep them , and welcome them into our ranks . This will better enable us to attract bright people from both within and outside the Party and both in China and abroad to join us in pursuing the great endeavor of the Party and the people .
We will encourage and guide people with talent to work in remote poor areas , border areas with mainly ethnic minority populations , and old revolutionary base areas , as well as in communities and on the fron@@ t@@ lines .
We will work to foster a positive environment in which everyone wants , strives , and is able to exce@@ l themselves , and can do full justice to their talents .
With this , we aim to see that in every field the creativity of talent is given great expression and their ingen@@ uity and expertise flow freely .
4 . Strengthening prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations
Prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations do the groundwork to ensure the Party ’ s lines , principles , policies , decisions , and plans are implemented .
We will work to ensure that prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations in enterprises , villages , Party and government departments , schools , research institutes , sub-@@ districts , communities , and social organizations play a key role in communicating the Party ’ s pro@@ positions , carrying out the Party ’ s decisions , overseeing commun@@ ity-@@ level social governance , uni@@ ting and mobilizing the people , and promoting reform and development .
In doing so , we will focus on improving the organizational capability of prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations and give priority to enhancing their political functions . Party branches should fulfill their responsibilities for directly guiding , managing , and overseeing their members and for organizing , communicating with , uni@@ ting , and serving the people .
They should encourage their members to play an exemplary role .
We must practice the system of holding Party branch general meetings , meetings of Party branch committees , Party group meetings , and Party lectures .
We will develop new ways for setting up prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations and for them to carry out their activities , strengthen the training of their heads , and expand their reach .
We must work harder to address the problems that some prim@@ ary-@@ level Party organizations are weak , ineffective , and marginalized .
We will expand intr@@ apar@@ ty democracy at the primary level , make Party affairs more transparent , and ensure channels are open for Party members to participate in Party affairs , oversee Party organizations and officials , and submit opinions and suggestions to the Party organization at the next level up .
We will do more to recruit new Party members from among industrial workers , young people working in agriculture , well-@@ educated groups , and people working in non-@@ public economic entities and social organizations .
We will give more incentives , sol@@ icit@@ ude , and assistance to Party members .
We will make our guidance and management of Party members better targeted and more effective , and handle Party members that don ’ t meet the mark in a prudent and orderly way .
5 . Working ceas@@ el@@ essly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline
Our Party comes from the people , has its roots among the people , and is dedicated to serving the people . Once the Party becomes dis@@ engaged from the people , it will lose its vitality .
In improving Party conduct , we must focus on maintaining the Party ’ s close bond with the people , keep them firmly in mind , develop a closer aff@@ inity with them , and keep working to foster stronger public support for the Party ’ s governance .
We must earnestly address all issues the people are strongly concerned about , and resolutely correct any behavior that undermines the people ’ s interests .
Our Party officials should lead by example in consolidating and building on the advances made in implementing the central Party leadership ’ s eight-@@ point decision on improving Party and government conduct .
We should continue to address the practice of formalities for formalities ’ sake , bureaucr@@ atism , he@@ don@@ ism , and extr@@ avag@@ ance , and oppose mind@@ sets and acts of privilege seeking .
We will focus on strengthening the enforcement of political and organizational discipline , and use this to prompt stricter observance of discipline on upholding integrity , on interacting with the people , and regarding work and life .
We will continue to carry out criticism and self-@@ criticism in keeping with the principle of learning from mistakes to prevent recurrence and treating the illness to save the patient .
We will conduct four forms of oversight over discipline compliance , identify problems early and correct them while they are nas@@ cent .
Party organizations with the power to supervise officials will be given corresponding power to take disciplinary action as called for , and accountability for overseeing discipline compliance will be tigh@@ tened up on .
We will raise Party members ’ awareness of discipline and strengthen discipline enforcement , and demand that Party members and officials hold discipline in a@@ we and respect , do not cross the line , and become used to working and living under oversight and constraints .
6 . Sec@@ uring a sweeping victory in the fight against corruption
The people res@@ ent corruption most ; and corruption is the greatest threat our Party faces .
We must have the resolve and ten@@ acity to per@@ severe in the ne@@ ver-@@ ending fight against corruption . Only by intensifying efforts to address both the symptoms and root causes of corruption — by making sure that officials are honest , government is clean , and political affairs are handled with integrity — can we avoid history ’ s cycle of rise and fall and ensure the long-term stability of the Party and the country .
Currently , the fight against corruption remains grave and complex ; we must remain as firm as a rock in our resolve to build on the overwhelming momentum and secure a sweeping victory .
We will continue to see that there are no no-@@ go zones , no ground is left un@@ turned , and no tolerance is shown for corruption .
We will impose tight constraints , maintain a tough stance and a long-term deterrence , punish both those who take bri@@ bes and those who offer them , and prevent interest groups from arising within the Party .
We will institute a system of disciplinary inspection for city and county level Party committees in an intensified effort to address corruption that occurs on the people ’ s door@@ steps . Where@@ ver offenders may flee , they will be brought back and brought to justice .
We will work for the adoption of national anti-corruption legislation and create a corruption reporting platform that covers both disciplinary inspection commissions and supervision agencies .
We will strengthen deterrence so officials don ’ t dare to , strengthen the cage of institutions so they ’ re unable to , and strengthen their vigilance so they have no desire to commit acts of corruption . Our political environment will , through tireless efforts , like seas fallen calm and rivers running clear , be clean and free of corruption .
7 . Improving Party and state oversight systems
To improve the Party ’ s ability to pur@@ ify itself , it is essential that we strengthen Party self-@@ supervision and subject ourselves to public oversight .
We must strengthen checks on and oversight over the exercise of power , and ensure that power is exercised under public oversight , in broad daylight , and in an institutional cage .
We will strengthen top-@@ down organizational oversight , improve bottom@@ -up democratic oversight , practice peer oversight , and tighten regular supervision over Party members in positions of leadership .
We will intensify political inspection to identify problems and ensure that deterrence works ; we will establish an oversight network that facilitates coordination in disciplinary inspections conducted at different levels .
We will deepen reform of the national supervision system , conduct trials throughout the country , and establish supervisory commissions at the national , provincial , prefec@@ tural , and county levels , which work together with the Party ’ s disciplinary inspection commissions as one office while keeping their own identity .
This will ensure that supervision covers everyone working in the public sector who exercises public power .
A national supervision law will be formulated . Supervisory commissions will be given responsibilities , powers , and means of investigation in accordance with law . The practice of shu@@ ang@@ gui will be replaced by detention .
We will reform the auditing management system and improve the statistics system .
We will establish an authoritative , efficient oversight system with complete coverage under the Party ’ s unified command ; and integrate intr@@ apar@@ ty oversight with oversight by state organs , democratic oversight , judicial oversight , public oversight , and oversight through public opinion . All this will create a powerful synergy for conducting oversight .
8 . Strengthening every dimension of our ability for governance
To lead a large socialist country of more than 1.3 billion people , our Party must be both politically strong and highly competent .
We should be good at learning .
We will foster a strong atmosphere of learning and practicing in the Party , and build our Party into a Marxist learning party . We will nurture a love of learning in our people .
We should be good at exercising political leadership .
We should adopt a strategic perspective , and develop creative thinking and a dialec@@ tical approach to thinking ; we should think in terms of the rule of law , and think about wor@@ st-@@ case scenarios .
We should formulate sound Party lines , principles , and policies and resolutely implement them , ensuring that the Party exercises overall leadership and coordinates work in all areas .
We should be good reform@@ ers and pione@@ ers .
We should be enter@@ prising , work cre@@ atively in light of actual conditions , and ade@@ p@@ tly apply information technology , including the internet , in our work .
We should be good at promoting sound development .
We should effectively put into practice the new development philosophy , and continue to break new ground in development .
We should be good at exercising law@@ -based governance .
We will act more quickly to put in place a system of Party rules and regulations that covers all aspects of Party leadership and Party building , and strengthen and improve Party leadership over bodies of state power .
We should be good at engaging with the people .
We will develop new systems , mechanisms , ways , and means for this work . We will urge trade unions , Chinese Communist Youth League organizations , women ’ s feder@@ ations , and other people ’ s organizations to strengthen their political consciousness , become more advanced , and better represent the people ; to play their role as bridges linking the Party with the people ; and to organize and motivate the people to follow the Party .
We should be good at implementing policy .
We should be open and frank , take effective measures to address real issues , and seek good outcomes . We should be ready both to act resolutely and swiftly and to make sustained efforts to tackle tough issues head@@ -on . We should have the per@@ severance to hammer away until a task is done , and make concrete , metic@@ ulous , and effective efforts in all our work .
We should be good at managing risks .
We will improve risk prevention and control mechanisms in all areas , skill@@ fully handle various complex issues , overcome all difficulties and obstacles that we meet on our way , and keep a firm hold on the initiative in our work .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
A great cause calls for leadership of a strong party .
As long as our Party keeps itself competent and strong , always remains true to the people ’ s aspiration and works in concert with the people , we can and will navigate the great ship bearing the great dream of the Chinese people to conquer the waves and reach our destination .
Com@@ r@@ ades ,
The Chinese nation is a great nation ; it has been through hardships and ad@@ versity but remains ind@@ om@@ itable . The Chinese people are a great people ; they are industri@@ ous and brave ; and they never pause in the pursuit of progress .
The Communist Party of China is a great party ; it has the courage to fight and the met@@ tle to win .
The wheels of history roll on ; the tides of the times are vast and mighty .
History looks kindly on those with resolve , with drive and ambition , and with plenty of gu@@ ts ; it won ’ t wait for the hes@@ itant , the ap@@ a@@ thetic , or those shy of a challenge .
All of us in the Party must work hard and live simply , guard against arrog@@ ance and impe@@ tu@@ osity ; and lose no time in progressing along the long march of the new era .
We must conscienti@@ ously safeguard the solidarity and unity of the Party , maintain the Party ’ s deep bond with the people , and strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the great unity of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation at home and abroad .
We must unite all the forces that can be united and work as one to progress toward the brilliant future of national rejuven@@ ation .
A nation will pros@@ per only when its young people thrive ;
a country will be full of hope and have a great tomorrow only when its younger generations have ideals , ability , and a strong sense of responsibility .
The Chinese Dream is a dream about history , the present , and the future .
It is a dream of our generation , but even more so , a dream of the younger generations .
The Chinese Dream of national rejuven@@ ation will be realized ultimately through the endeav@@ ors of young people , generation by generation .
All of us in the Party should care about young people and set the stage for them to exce@@ l .
To all our young people , you should have firm ideals and convictions , aim high , and have your feet firmly on the ground . You should ride the waves of your day ; and in the course of realizing the Chinese Dream , fulfill your you@@ thful dreams , and write a vivid chapter in your tireless endeav@@ ors to serve the interests of the people .
A just cause should be pursued for the common good .
Roo@@ ted in a land of more than 9.6 million square kilometers , nourished by a nation ’ s culture of more than 5,000 years , and backed by the inv@@ inci@@ ble force of more than 1.3 billion people , we have an infin@@ itely vast stage of our era , a historical heritage of un@@ matched depth , and in@@ comparable resolve that enable us to forge ahead on the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We , the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups , should rally closely around the Party Central Committee , and hold high the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
We should keep on working with great determination to accomplish the three historic tasks of advancing modernization , realizing China ’ s reunification , and preserving world peace and promoting common development ; we should secure a decisive victory in finishing the building of a moder@@ ately prosperous society in all respects , strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era , realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuven@@ ation , and see that our people realize their aspirations for a better life .
