The wind blew through the can@@ yon and set off waves to the pra@@ i@@ rie .
The wild cows that were b@@ owing to eat the green grass looked up towards the sky .
There , a ten-@@ meter long wooden merchant ship was floating in the air . The ship moved forward slowly as the sail bel@@ lied with the wind .
“ No matter how you see it , this scenery sure is a magnificent one . ”
A middle-@@ aged man in leather armor stood next to the deck , looking down at the endless grass@@ land and its beauty .
“ For us merchants , this is also a rare opportunity . ”
Standing next to the middle-@@ aged man was a slightly overweight merchant . He had a weird cur@@ ly hair and was wearing a merchant ’ s robe . His small eyes were slightly narrow@@ ed as if he was planning something while gaz@@ ing at the scenery in front of him . Looking at him , it was as if he was thinking that the beautiful scenery in front of him could be sold .
“ If it were not for this thing , I am afraid we won ’ t be able to move the goods into the central area this quickly . ”
“ To be honest , I always opposed the idea of opening a market , but now it seems that my choice was correct . ”
“ Please forgive me for being frank , but if you do not choose a wider route , even if we went from here , although it will save more time , the degree of danger will also increase . ”
“ I heard that the other side is not quiet , and I think you have also listened to the captain ’ s reminder that it seems there were Wind Ser@@ p@@ ents around here recently , what if … ”
The man ’ s face dark@@ ened . He turned his head , shifting his sight to somewhere not far from the mountains .
Tow@@ ering peaks blocked his line of sight , making him unable to see what was behind .
But he could fain@@ tly perceive that the distant sky was not pure blue , and there was a touch of clou@@ dy darkness .
That ’ s not the world they should get involved with .
“ Do not worry , how can there be so many if@@ s ? Money comes from danger . This is the reason why I spend so much money to hire you ! ”
“ Only a few ser@@ p@@ ents , is that not it ? ”
The merchant stretched out his hand and pat@@ ted the man ’ s shoulder .
“ Yes , what about the condition of the young man we saved ? ”
“ Is he still alive ? ”
“ L@@ ize has band@@ aged his wound , and now he is sleeping . His condition supposedly will not be life-@@ threatening . ”
“ That ’ s good . ”
Hearing the man ’ s answer , the merchant nodded with satisfaction , but then he quickly f@@ row@@ ned .
“ But what kind of wound is that from ? Looking at the wound , it seems like it was from a big li@@ z@@ ard , but is there anything like that in the north of Pap@@ hi@@ eld ? ”
“ I do not know , Lord , but it ’ s supposedly a very fer@@ oci@@ ous beast . I hope we do not run into them . ”
While talking , the man ’ s eyes sub@@ consciously swept the entrance of the cabin , then he turned his head again , looking forward .
Rho@@ de opened his eyes .
W-@@ what happened ?
He stared at the ceiling ; his brain was di@@ zzy .
He remembered that he had been leading his team to fight the most powerful boss in the Dragon Soul Contin@@ ent , the Vo@@ id Dragon , and had successfully gotten the first kill . He was sure that he had got the achievement and system prompt , but then , the Vo@@ id Dragon ’ s last attack also took his life away .
According to his plan , Rho@@ de should ’ ve res@@ pa@@ w@@ ned and then he would log out .
But the moment he was killed by the Vo@@ id Dragon , his whole vision immediately become dark , as if he was forced to log off . Then he lost his consciousness .
How can this be ?
Did I encounter a bug in the game ?
Rho@@ de could barely turn his head , but he still managed to catch a glimpse of the blue az@@ ure sky and white clouds outside . Where is he ?
What ’ s this place ?
What happened ?
Is he dreaming ?
Or is he still in the game ?
At least he was sure that this place wasn ’ t his small rental apartment .
Dou@@ b@@ ts immediately flooded his mind . Then , Rho@@ de f@@ row@@ ned and tried to get up .
“ U@@ g@@ h ! ”
Suddenly , he felt an acute pain from his chest . He bit his lips and stopped moving .
He found that his left shoulder and chest had been completely wrapped by a band@@ age . Although he did not know what happened , judging from the blood sta@@ in that perme@@ ated it , it seemed that his injury was quite severe .
This is definitely not a game .
Rho@@ de was undoubtedly certain of this . He knew that although the current technology was quite advanced , and as the world ’ s first virtual reality game , Dragon Soul Contin@@ ent Online had also used a lot of high-tech technology , but according to the rules , it was impossible for the player to experience pain . The reason was so that people could distinguish between reality and the game .
Also , for the sake of the players , they had to reduce the pain threshold . If the player was injured , instead of pain , the game would reduce the player ’ s speed and use red color to block the player ’ s line of sight . It was done so to warn and remind them , rather than the real simulation of pain .
When the virtual reality simulation technology first appeared in the world , it had caused a lot of controversi@@ es . Dragon Soul Contin@@ ent ’ s operating company naturally knew it too .
Rho@@ de lowered his head and looked at his right hand . Its shape was not like his character from the game ; his body was not that full of muscle nor was it mighty .
On the contrary , the arm in front of him was small and thin . Since he had almost never exposed himself to the sunlight , his skin was a little bit pale .
This was definitely his own body ; he was sure of it .
However , how did he get hurt ?
Was this place a hospital ?
Rho@@ de scanned his surroundings ; the whole room looked like a cabin — no lights , no phone , no call bell .
A wooden table , two chairs and a fixed cabinet on the wall were the only things in the room .
He did not know why , but he felt like he had seen this somewhere .
While he was studying the room carefully , the door suddenly opened .
A blonde girl wearing a white robe entered the room . She looked at Rho@@ de who was half-@@ sitting in surprise , with her eyes wide open .
“ You have wo@@ ken up ? That ’ s great ! ! ”
The girl did not speak Chinese or English , but he seemed to be able to clearly understand it .
He could not help but feel a little bit surprised because he knew the language too .
This is the Nim@@ us language , one of the official language in the Dragon Soul Contin@@ ent !
“ How are you feeling ? ”
However , the girl did not care about Rho@@ de ’ s expression . She quickly went to his side , carefully checking his left shoulder and chest .
“ Your injury is really serious . Frank@@ ly , I was worried whether you would survive or not … ”
“ This is … ”
He f@@ row@@ ned but did not know what to say . He turned his head , looking at the mirror next to the wall where a clear reflection of his face could be seen . It was indeed his face , no doubt about it , but it was not supposed to appear here .
“ Did you forget ? ”
The blonde girl cur@@ iously blin@@ ked her eyes , her twin tails following her movement . Her blue eyes were clear and transparent , ex@@ ud@@ ing a cheerful disposition .
“ Two days ago , you fell in the middle of the Pap@@ hi@@ eld Pla@@ ins and suffered a very serious injury . ”
“ If it was not because of the Silver Li@@ bra ’ s merchant guil@@ d floating ship passing by , I am afraid it would be even worse . ”
“ I do not know what kind of monster you fought against , but the left side of your body received a very serious injury . It can be really dangerous . ”
Wait , left shoulder …
Rho@@ de fro@@ ze in surprise for a moment . He immediately thought about the last battle with the Vo@@ id Dragon before , wasn ’ t it his left shoulder that was attacked ?
But it was his game av@@ atar that was injured , and there was supposed to be no connection to the player itself , right ? But now , the one who got injured was him ?
Although the situation in front of him was a mess , Rho@@ de still quickly cal@@ med down . As the top player and the world strongest guil@@ d leader , he had a strong mentality , and in the middle of the conversation with the blonde girl in front of him , he had also learned about his current situation .
He was seriously injured in the Pap@@ hi@@ eld Pla@@ ins , and Silver Li@@ bra Mer@@ chant Guil@@ d floating ship happened to pass by , so they saved him .
According to what the blonde girl had said , his condition was pretty bad , but his ability to recover was pretty good .
“ My name is L@@ ize No@@ ir , I am a member of the Crescent Star mercenary group . I am a Cler@@ ic . You can just call me L@@ ize . ”
The girl straight@@ forwar@@ dly introduced herself to Rho@@ de .
“ I ’ m Rho@@ de Al@@ ander . ”
Even though he still could not completely sort out the situation , he hes@@ itated for a moment , but he still told her his ID from the game .
“ I am an adven@@ turer from the Eastern Pla@@ ins . ”
“ So you are an adven@@ turer , that was why you were alone in the vast mountain . ”
After hearing Rho@@ de ’ s answer , L@@ ize did not feel surprised because , in this continent , there were many adven@@ turers who liked to explore alone , so Rho@@ de ’ s identity was not much of a problem .
“ But what kind of thing did you fight with actually ? ”
” How did you get such a serious injury ? “
“ I remember that there should be no high level@@ ed mon@@ sters in particular in the plains . ”
Hearing her inquiry , Rho@@ de showed a bitter smile .
What could he say ? Should he say that he was injured because he fought one of the five creator dr@@ agons , the Vo@@ id Dragon ?
“ I did not see what it was because I was attacked at night . There were a lot of them and they were very quick . I think that maybe they were things from ‘ the other side ’ . ”
“ I understand . ”
Although Rho@@ de did not elaborate , L@@ ize seemed to know what it was and nodded . By then , she had also finished checking at Rho@@ de ’ s wound , so she stood up .
“ You have not eaten for two days , so you must be hungry . Please wait . I will get some food for you to eat . ”
“ Ah , yes , I would like to report this matter to my leader , I think he will come to see you soon . ”
Having said that , she nodded towards him pol@@ itely and then left the room .
Under the suppression of mort@@ ars , the military base was in chaos . No one noticed a special force team sne@@ aking in .
Without ex@@ pending extra effort , K@@ ut@@ po@@ v placed a be@@ acon on the target then withdrew from the base with the team . After they safely arrived at the evacuation point , they called for an air@@ strike .
Soon , the Russian ste@@ alth bom@@ ber wh@@ iz@@ zed through the clouds , and the four bombs landed precisely on the two ammunition de@@ pots and two fuel de@@ pots at the base .
The shock wave of the explosion was sent through the entire base and collapsed the concrete buildings around the points of impact .
The exploded ammunition and burning fire@@ balls were sent scat@@ tering across the camp and caused a series of chain explosions . Fl@@ ames , blood , and corp@@ ses were everywhere .
The guards stationed at the base suffered severe casualties , and the rest were injured .
Medical soldiers with stret@@ chers rushed inside the base . They searched for the wounded and im@@ mobilized .
The engineer soldiers with heavy explo@@ sion-@@ proof suits rushed into the flames to pull out any unexploded ammunition from the ruins .
All the soldiers who could still move began to mobilize while they searched for their missing team members .
Sar@@ des looked at the fire outside the window , and despair gradually appeared in his blank pupils .
Smoke covered the entire base . Fl@@ ame sta@@ ined the entire night sky red . The scene resem@@ bled do@@ om@@ sday .
“ S@@ h * t … ”
Sar@@ des mut@@ tered to himself . He moved his heavy legs and slowly left the window .
When he turned around , his eyes met his advisor ’ s eyes .
“ Sir , what should we do ? ”
The explosion finally stopped . There were no more chain reactions at the base . However , nobody could be cal@@ med . The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew it was just the beginning of their night@@ mare .
The previous explosion seemed to ign@@ ite a signal and sign@@ aled an attack from the Sami Army .
Under the orders of Jiang Chen , Sami seized this fle@@ eting opportunity . He jumped in front of everyone and brought all the remaining refugees to the fron@@ t@@ lines .
More than six thousand people charged into the tun@@ dra , into the burning p@@ ines .
It was a spectacular scene .
At the same time , looking at the smoke rising from behind the base , all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines were pan@@ icking . Their previ@@ ous@@ ly-@@ boos@@ ted morale dropped to roc@@ k-@@ bottom in an instant .
Even if they could defend their position , they were unwilling to fight .
Without any sus@@ pense , Ar@@ row ’ s defense line was penetrated , and the un@@ cooperative mercenaries collapsed in front of the Sami Army .
Some of them fled back to the burning base , but most of them deserted and fled deep into the woods .
Jiang Chen didn ’ t need to remind them since even a pig would know what to do next .
Jiang Chen watched as Sami began to launch an attack on the military base then he put away his bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars . He took out an off-@@ road motorcycle from the storage dimension and pat@@ ted Ay@@ es@@ ha ’ s back gently .
“ It ’ s time , let ’ s go . ”
“ M@@ h@@ mm ! ”
Ay@@ es@@ ha nodded , and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle , she also hop@@ ped on behind him .
The engine ro@@ ared and the belt shat@@ tered the snow .
Jiang Chen rushed down the hill@@ side and turned to the side of the military base . He then par@@ ked the motorcycle on the side , took out a laser sword from the storage dimension , and stro@@ ked it in his hand . The bar@@ bed fence was shred@@ ded easily .
The entire base was immer@@ sed in fire and chaos , and there were still explosions from mort@@ ars from time to time . All the mercenaries fought on the front line and fought with the refugees for control of the entrance .
Except for a company guarding the command center , no one was in the rear .
For Jiang Chen and Ay@@ es@@ ha , it was no different than having no defense .
A total of ten guards — two guards standing in the s@@ entry tower , and the remaining eight were stationed at the entrance of the first and second floors .
Ay@@ es@@ ha took out the Ghost S@@ ni@@ per R@@ if@@ le and quietly took down the two guards standing in the tower then used blind spots in their field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and down@@ stairs one by one .
When Ay@@ es@@ ha took care of the guards , Jiang Chen took out a rifle and moved to the command center . Just as he passed the Hum@@ mer at the entrance , he just happened to b@@ ump into Sar@@ des and his advisor fleeing .
When their eyes met , both sides stopped .
The advisor first responded and immediately pulled out his gun , but he didn ’ t reach them in time before Ay@@ es@@ ha pinned him down .
Sar@@ des was trying to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and his hands were pinned against the Hum@@ mer .
“ Sar@@ des , male , 43 . ”
“ The general manager of Ar@@ row and the highest commander . Am I right ? ”
Although it was the first time they were meeting , Jiang Chen ’ s hol@@ ographic hel@@ met , which was connected to the Ghost Agent ’ s database , stored photos and personal information related to Sar@@ des .
His information was projected onto the hol@@ ographic screen .
Sar@@ des ’ face was pressed against the hood of the vehicle . He was certainly tough as he was reluctant to surrender . He gn@@ ashed his teeth .
“ I won ’ t say anything . Just kill me … ”
“ K@@ ill you ? ”
“ I didn ’ t ask anything yet . ”
Jiang Chen grin@@ ned and smiled . He didn ’ t care about Sar@@ des ’ un@@ cooperative attitude . Jiang Chen freed his right hand , pulled out a needle and injected it into Sar@@ des ’ back .
“ AH@@ H@@ H@@ H ! ”
Sar@@ des grow@@ led in resistance . His eyes began to look blood@@ shot , and soon , the light in his pupils f@@ aded .
Jiang Chen simply let his hands go . No ordinary person could resist the tru@@ th-@@ telling serum .
Jiang Chen turned Sar@@ des around and asked one word at a time .
“ Where is Carmen ? ”
“ Underground research institute in the underground bun@@ ker … ”
“ Where is the underground bun@@ ker ? ”
“ The entrance is in the middle of the base and can only be accessed through the elevator . ”
“ There are two ap@@ r@@ ons next to the entrance . ”
Jiang Chen soon got the information he wanted .
“ Good , now your wish has been granted . ”
Jiang Chen took out a pistol and ended him then tos@@ sed his body aside .
It was a quick way to die , but for the well-known Ar@@ row general manager Mr. Sar@@ des , death in this obscure form might be more painful than death itself … if the dead felt pain .
“ The underground bun@@ ker ? ”
Looking at the center of the base , Jiang Chen s@@ nee@@ red .
No matter what Carmen was plo@@ tting , his good fortune should be over .
The fate of the Ro@@ th@@ s@@ child family would end as it began , fame because of a war , obsc@@ urity because of a war …
However , at that moment , there were fierce scre@@ ams from the distance .
“ What are you people doing ! ? ! ”
Old Mr. Dong@@ g@@ ong hol@@ le@@ red an@@ gr@@ ily while knoc@@ king his walking stick against the ground .
“ Our ances@@ tor is almost here . Mr. Dong@@ g@@ ong , please don ’ t get too impati@@ ent . You ’ ll find out what we ’ re going to do soon enough . ”
Old Mr. Dong@@ g@@ ong knew exactly who “ ances@@ tor ” referred to .
He was at a sudden loss for what to do , and he had no idea why Pe@@ i Yi was here .
It was not a wise decision to go against the D@@ K Organization . Although everyone in R Nation wanted to anni@@ hil@@ ate them , it was practically impossible .
It was a far-@@ fet@@ ched idea .
A few minutes later , Pe@@ i Yi ’ s car arrived .
He al@@ ighted from his car and shifted his gaze onto the car that An Xia@@ oning was in .
An Xia@@ oning al@@ ighted from the car without removing her wig or mask .
Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i followed suit .
“ You ’ re here , ” said An Xia@@ oning .
Pe@@ i Yi scanned her from head to toe and ch@@ uck@@ led before walking toward her . He in@@ ched even closer toward her and said softly , “ I doubt those people can recognize you under this disgu@@ ise . ”
“ Of course . I did this just so they wouldn ’ t find out my identity . It ’ s not yet time for me to reveal my identity . That ’ s the reason I got you to come here . ”
Pe@@ i Yi glanced at Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i and asked An Xia@@ oning , “ Why are you with him ? ”
“ For some issue . ”
He stood up straight , turned around , and said to the members of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family with a smile , “ Just what did my younger sister do to your family ? Why did you have the aud@@ acity to try and kill her ? ”
“ Are you people tired of living ? ”
The members of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family turned pale the instant that they heard his words . Pe@@ i Yi ’ s sister ?
Since when did he have a sister ?
Old Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong said , “ We really had no idea … that she ’ s Mr. Pe@@ i ’ s sister . ”
“ I ’ m telling you now that she ’ s my sister . ”
“ Did you hear me ? ” Pe@@ i Yi said col@@ dly .
“ Since you ’ ve said that she ’ s your sister , please take her away , Mr. Pe@@ i . As for Dong@@ g@@ ong Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i , he ’ s a member of my family and his name is registered on my family ’ s ancestral records . He ’ s still part of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family , so it ’ s up to us to decide what to do with him . ”
Before Pe@@ i Yi answered , the quick@@ -@@ w@@ itted An Xia@@ oning hur@@ ri@@ edly said , “ Brother , he ’ s my boyfriend and I ’ m carrying his child now . We can ’ t abandon him . ”
Pe@@ i Yi initially wanted to take only An Xia@@ oning away , but things turned out to be tric@@ ki@@ er than what he had expected .
However , there was nothing the tyr@@ ann@@ ical Pe@@ i Yi couldn ’ t do , as long as he wanted to do it .
“ Old Lady , you heard her . This man … could be considered as my brother@@ -in-law now . They already have a child now . If I let you guys have him , wouldn ’ t the child be father@@ less ? ”
“ Do you think I ’ d agree to that ? ”
Old Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong knew clearly that if she were to let Pe@@ i Yi take Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i away , it would be impossible for her to get rid of her grand@@ son openly from now on . Hence , she refused to bud@@ ge , despite fe@@ aring the D@@ K ’ s authority and power .
“ Mr. Pe@@ i , I ’ m afraid we can ’ t let you have him . Our family has our own set of rules . No out@@ siders are allowed to intervene when we ’ re punishing the members of our family . ”
“ Like I said , he ’ s the father of my sister ’ s child . Are you deaf ? ”
Pe@@ i Yi then looked at Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i and said , “ Are you a member of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family ? ”
“ When my mother delivered some pois@@ oned dishes to me this morning , I had already se@@ vered all ties with her . Prior to this , the Dong@@ g@@ ong family tried to kill me , Ms. An , and her subordin@@ ates under the fac@@ ade of it being an accident . I already knew then that I ’ m no longer a member of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family , although it says so in the official records . My last name is now ‘ Wu . ’ My name is Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i . I no longer belong to the Dong@@ g@@ ong family ! ”
His words were cold , harsh , and full of impact .
The fact that he had the courage to make such a declaration in front of everyone just went to show that he was determined to cut ties with his family .
Old Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong bar@@ ked , “ It ’ s not your call ! Once you ’ ve become a member of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family , you always will be ! ”
“ Old Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong , may I ask you something ? Now that Ms. An is already aware of your attempt to kill her , aren ’ t you afraid that she would intervene too ? ”
Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i said da@@ un@@ t@@ lessly in an aus@@ ter@@ e tone .
Pe@@ i Yi smiled and chim@@ ed in , “ I do know Ms. An personally , and she ’ s definitely one to take revenge where it ’ s due . You guys tried to kill her . Do you think she would take it lying down ? ”
“ Okay , enough with the cra@@ p . My time is precious . I ’ m taking both of them away with me . ”
No@@ tic@@ ing that the members of the Dong@@ g@@ ong family were about to speak again , he added , “ You should know what to do if you don ’ t want there to be any blood@@ shed . ”
Hence , the Dong@@ g@@ ong family watched as their metic@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly-@@ pre@@ med@@ itated plan back@@ fired .
Old Mr. and Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong were beyond ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated .
Finally , Old Mrs. Dong@@ g@@ ong said , “ For@@ get it , forget it . We ’ ll just remove his name from the family records and the household register ! ”
“ We have to go back to S Nation . ”
Pe@@ i Yi gave her the side-@@ eye and gi@@ bed , “ Are you burning the bridge after you crossed over it ? ”
“ Did@@ n ’ t you say that you ’ d promise me something ? I haven ’ t even informed you of my request and yet you ’ re already intending to return to your country ? ”
“ I just have something important to handle back home , but I meant it when I said that I would agree to one of your requests . Tell me , what do you have in mind ? ”
“ H@@ mm , my request might put you in a difficult spot … ”
“ Don ’ t bring it up , then . Give me another request that won ’ t put me in a spot . ”
Pe@@ i Yi turned to look at her and said , “ You really haven ’ t changed at all . Ac@@ company me for half a month . ”
“ How ? ”
“ Like you used to in the past . ”
Gaz@@ ing at him , An Xia@@ oning refused , “ That can ’ t do . Firstly , I don ’ t want to be ch@@ ained and have my freedom restricted . Two weeks is too long . I ’ m fine with two days . ”
The smile on Pe@@ i Yi ’ s face stiff@@ ened a little and he chas@@ ti@@ sed , “ You ’ re going over@@ board with the bargaining . Five days , no fewer than that . Since you agreed to let me make my request , you can ’ t go back on your word . I ’ ll definitely let you have your freedom . ”
“ Can you let me return home first , then ? ”
“ No . ”
After hearing their conversation , Wu Li@@ an@@ zh@@ i could not help but wonder , Are they in a relationship ?
Is it a complicated one ?
Why does it sound like it ?
If they ’ re really in a relationship , they ’ re being too bra@@ zen in front of me .
An Xia@@ oning negotiated , “ Let him return to S Nation while I stay at your place . Will that do ? ”
“ I won ’ t do anything to you guys . He may come along , ” Pe@@ i Yi said ins@@ is@@ tently .
An Xia@@ oning did not argue any further .
They arrived shortly after they left the Dong@@ g@@ ong family man@@ sion , because it was not too far away from Mount Qing@@ ping .
An Xia@@ oning was filled with a mix of emotions .
Qin Guo was overwhelmed with dis@@ pleasure the instant she saw An Xia@@ oning . After they entered , she immediately rolled her eyes in anno@@ yance .
Why did An@@ ces@@ tor bring this j@@ in@@ xed troubl@@ emaker back again ?
Yan Rus@@ heng rolled his eyes . “ Wen X@@ ux@@ u , you think too highly of yourself . ”
“ Are you impl@@ ying that I ’ m not pretty ? ”
Wen X@@ ux@@ u pou@@ ted as she f@@ row@@ ned at him .
Yan Rus@@ heng was moment@@ arily st@@ umped before breaking into a smile . His hand , which was on her waist , traveled to her chest before he pin@@ ched her .
He bent to gl@@ are at her with mal@@ ice in his eyes . “ You … sly and stupid woman . ”
He has@@ tened his foot@@ steps and walked to the bed . Th@@ rowing his gent@@ l@@ eness to the wind , he threw X@@ ux@@ u on the bed . Then he removed his shirt impati@@ ently .
After removing his belt and every other clothing on him , he p@@ ounced on X@@ ux@@ u .
He was rough and acting on his wh@@ ims .
He gaz@@ ed into the depths of X@@ ux@@ u ’ s eyes and her heart@@ beat rac@@ ed rapidly .
After all these years , her heart would still pound and race whenever she looked into his eyes . She would always feel bas@@ h@@ ful and shy .
Perhaps she was too familiar with him . Hence she found it embarr@@ assing .
It was true that a rabbit shouldn ’ t eat the grass by its own bur@@ row . And never to target your close ones .
He watched as X@@ ux@@ u ’ s face turned red , and he was consumed with excitement and a tw@@ inge of anno@@ yance . He was excited because of hormones and his sur@@ ging desires , and yet he was anno@@ yed by how she acted .
Although he liked how bas@@ h@@ ful and shy she was , he didn ’ t like how reserved and alo@@ of she was . She never took the initiative .
“ What else do you want to know ? I ’ ll tell you everything . Look at me . ”
Yan Rus@@ heng pressed his hands against the sides of X@@ ux@@ u ’ s face as he forced her to look into his eyes .
X@@ ux@@ u turned cr@@ im@@ son once more , and her eyes fl@@ ic@@ ke@@ red back and forth . She said , “ Then say it . Did you steal any other love letters ? ”
“ H@@ m@@ mm … ”
Yan Rus@@ heng ’ s face crum@@ pled with concentration . “ Other than Zhao Zheng ’ s love letter and Jiang Zhu@@ o@@ heng ’ s chocolate and movie tickets , there was one more . Ha@@ o Bang , the son of the public security bureau chief , who was one grade above us . He gave you a rain@@ bow@@ -@@ colored candy . ”
X@@ ux@@ u was star@@ tled . “ What ? Ha@@ o Bang ? ”
The top sco@@ rer for Sciences in the college entrance exams ?
All the students tend to word@@ play on his name and coupled with his reputation , everyone addressed him as Aw@@ esome .
When she first heard of this name , she remembered him instantly .
But wasn ’ t he a ner@@ d ? Why would he send her a gift ?
“ Ex@@ actly , I hated his name . And whoever gave him that name . ”
Yan Rus@@ heng his@@ sed men@@ ac@@ ingly . “ L@@ uck@@ ily , I ate the candy . It was filled with food col@@ oring that it sta@@ ined my entire tongue with all the colors . It ’ s a rub@@ b@@ ish food . And mis@@ erly ! ”
X@@ ux@@ u was speech@@ less .
So , according to him , she should be thank@@ ful that he ate the candy on her behalf ?
X@@ ux@@ u bit back a laugh while feeling anno@@ yed too . Her eyes ro@@ ved over his face and she j@@ ab@@ bed him hard in his forehead . “ Yan Rus@@ heng , you ’ re really atro@@ ci@@ ous ! ”
He had gotten what he wanted , and yet he was still pre@@ tending . This was really his for@@ te .
Am@@ used , she pro@@ bed , “ So because of his son , you dis@@ liked bureau chief ? ”
She may have posed him a question , but she sounded asser@@ tive .
Yan Rus@@ heng pressed his lips quietly to admit it .
X@@ ux@@ u accidentally met his eyes once more and her face turned red . She hur@@ ri@@ edly aver@@ ted her gaze .
She asked , “ How did you manage to do all these ? Why wasn ’ t I aware at all ? ”
She pou@@ ted . Her mind rac@@ ed for other things to say .
In that moment , Xiao M@@ o ’ s heart was completely shred@@ ded by sadness .
The Du Zhu … didn ’ t dare to move .
Once the body moved , the brain would also began to move . He was so clever , how could he not know that Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei was dead .
He didn ’ t want to admit it , couldn ’ t bear to think too deeply . He could only force himself to sit like this . To convince himself that Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei just sl@@ um@@ bering , that she would wake up .
Xiao M@@ o thought that only when Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei ’ s body began to rot , would the Du Zhu would really recover his san@@ ity . Re@@ alizing that he was holding hands with a person who had been dead for many hours .
But strang@@ ely , Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei ’ s body did not change .
Rather her pale complex@@ ion was much better . A@@ side from the col@@ dness of her body , there was no reason to suspect that she wasn ’ t just resting .
No trace of the characteristics of a corp@@ se appeared .
As M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un stayed beside her , his eyes were getting brighter and brighter .
The divine doctor , that rot@@ ten old man was finally escorted in . He ate a heart protecting p@@ ill , “ I estimate this old life is also mostly gone . “
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un had not slept for five days , who couldn ’ t see how physically tired he was .
Yet his whole consciousness was unusually awake , terri@@ bly so@@ ber and abnormal .
“ After I let her take the medicine , she just fell asleep . I think I should have you come take a look , when will she wake up ? ”
The old man sighed as he went to the bed@@ side to take Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei ’ s pulse .
“ In fact , this phenomenon is extremely rare , and it does not need a cure , but there is a particularly important thing to do … ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un listened atten@@ tively , like a good student . There was a fire in his eyes .
The old man ’ s voice became quie@@ ter , “ That is to heal another person … ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un leaned forward , unwilling to miss his words .
The result was the rot@@ ten old man ’ s technique struck like lightning , and in an instant a needle was stuck in My Y@@ anj@@ un ’ s neck .
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un ’ s eyes suddenly widened , his hand already striking toward the top of the bad old man ’ s head .
Xiao M@@ o ’ s hand shot out and blocked M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un ’ s attack .
After this sequence of events , M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un was unable to endure and fell unconscious .
The old man touched his head , “ I almost died , but my guess is , I will not live long anyway . It would be good if he woke up without going crazy . ”
Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei was not going to come back .
And M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un ’ s condition was simply distress entering the heart and spirit , five vis@@ cer@@ a six bow@@ els all developed problems .
Did@@ n ’ t eat , didn ’ t sleep , didn ’ t think , didn ’ t move , he lived no different from the dead . If he stayed up for two days more , it can be assumed that he would also go together with Ba@@ i Wei@@ wei .
Xiao M@@ o looked at the old man , “ You will preserve the life of my family ’ s Du Zhu . If you can ’ t protect him this time , I will kill you by myself . ”
Having said that , she turned around and silently went to the place they received punishment .
The old man sighed , “ No wonder my master said , you can ’ t buy sweet potatoes in the capital as a divine doctor . Everyone takes me for a god , but even a god can ’ t make a person who wants to die to live , ah . ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un only slept for two hours , then his eyes opened .
He was shocked , his eyes revealed a rare panic when he found himself unable to move .
The rot@@ ten old man saw he was awake , “ I gave you ac@@ upuncture , your heart was in decline , but I gave you treatment . Otherwise , you would go to see King Y@@ ama . ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un eyes were dark . His face was pale , but full of anger , enough to make others sh@@ ud@@ der .
The old man pi@@ er@@ ced him with another needle , “ I didn ’ t want to save you , after all , your heart is in@@ compar@@ ably poisonous . To save someone like you today , wouldn ’ t it mean that the world will be mess@@ ed up . ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un ’ s voice was soft and strange , “ Let me go . ”
The old man shook his head , “ This I can not , I couldn ’ t save the little person in your heart . Saving you is compensation . ”
M@@ u Y@@ anj@@ un suddenly began to smile bit@@ terly , “ You can ’ t pay , how could it be compensated , even if you saved all the world , it couldn ’ t repay one hair of hers . ” Finally Safe from D@@ anger
As a cur@@ b@@ stom@@ p ensu@@ ed , both parties opened fire . The smell of gun@@ powder filled the air above the sea .
The high-@@ velocity magnetic wave gun in Ba@@ i Ye ’ s hands fired again and another plane was destroyed by him . This gun was nothing short of perfect and he was getting hoo@@ ked . The young kid kept commanding with calm and ease . The First Terrorist Organization ’ s air force became an im@@ pregn@@ able force that attacked and defended whilst they prepared their final round of attack .
Nikol@@ ai saw how bad things were and could not be any more concerned about his ego and loudly said , “ Master , let ’ s retreat . If we keep this up , we will be utterly dec@@ im@@ ated . ”
Louis , a sin@@ ister look on his face , cl@@ en@@ ched his f@@ ists tightly as rage eman@@ ated from him . While he could try to clearly and sensi@@ bly assess the situation , reluctance over@@ came him .
All his hard work had gone to waste as he was defeated with them within his grasp . Dam@@ n it !
A mur@@ der@@ ous intent fl@@ ashed past his emer@@ ald eyes and then sank into silent mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y . He turned to Nikol@@ ai and nodded as he immediately ordered a retreat .
Louis focused his gaze at the two of them who drif@@ ted above the sea and col@@ dly har@@ rum@@ ph@@ ed . They were lucky this time , and he would not allow it to slide .
“ Dar@@ ling child , they are retre@@ ating . Shall we pursue them ? ” Ba@@ i Ye smiled . He took a special li@@ king to this magnetic wave gun and hug@@ ged it as though he was hug@@ ging his child . He cur@@ led his lips into a calm and dangerous smile .
The young kid ele@@ gan@@ tly smiled and halted the attack . There was a deep calm in his eyes as he slowly said , “ If we stop the chase and let him die , it would be such a waste . This game of cat and mouse has just begun . ”
The tables have turned .
Louis should really have not and damn not ought to p@@ iss him off . He must find somebody to die with Nu@@ o Nu@@ o .
While Louis could dict@@ ate how and when the game ought to be played …
The young kid col@@ dly smiled aggres@@ sively . He would call the shots on how and when the game shall end .
Ba@@ i Ye smiled as he w@@ aved his hand hand@@ som@@ ely . “ No@@ ted , we ’ ll call off the pursuit . We have the resources to play along with him . For all you know , somebody else will take care of Louis before we take action . ”
The young kid col@@ dly smiled as he looked in the direction they escaped .
“ Ch@@ u Li , the battle has ended , so there ’ s no need for support . Let ’ s immediately R@@ TB . ”
Ba@@ i Ye ordered his men to return to Rome after ending his call with Ch@@ u Li .
Black Eagle and company dragged Third Young Master Ye and Cheng An@@ ya up with immense effort . As they knew that Cheng An@@ ya had a virus on her , they were already prepared from the start . Third Young Master Ye also warned them that he carried a virus in him , so Black Eagle and company also took precautions .
Third Young Master Ye lied down and pan@@ ted . He could not help but kick Miss Cheng . “ Dear An@@ ya , you are so heavy and have to lose weight . ”
His shoulders were a little num@@ b from swimming in the sea for a long time . To consume that much energy from swimming and hang Cheng An@@ ya to swing in this manner took its toll on his el@@ b@@ ows .
He almost dropped her into the ocean . He felt chil@@ ly as he recalled it .
Black Eagle and company che@@ ered for their safety and those who had to give towels and pour hot water did what they had to do . With everyone extremely busy , some even m@@ used and asked Third Young Master Ye how life in the past few days had been .
On the plane , the men gathered and it was bus@@ tling to life with hero@@ ism .
Cheng An@@ ya took the towel from Black Eagle to dry her hair and then wrap her shi@@ vering body . She ignored what he said . She was finally safe . She s@@ nee@@ zed and could not help but wrap herself tigh@@ ter with her towel .
Black Eagle broke into a smile and said , “ Third master , if mad@@ am was any skin@@ ni@@ er , you would call her ri@@ bs . ”
“ I am about to . ”
Third Young Master Ye also dried himself off the sea@@ water . “ This is why ri@@ bs are so important . ”
Keeping in line with the ad@@ age that ‘ silence is golden ’ , Cheng An@@ ya remained silent . Black Eagle got them two sets of clothes for them to change into . As they were men ’ s clothes , Cheng An@@ ya looked com@@ ical in them . She instead used a blanket and wrapped herself in them .
Just as she finished changing her clothes , Black Eagle told her that N@@ ing N@@ ing wanted to speak to her .
Cheng An@@ ya exci@@ tedly grabbed over the head@@ set . “ Dar@@ ling , Mom@@ my ’ s here . ”
“ Hi , Mom@@ my , do you miss your darling child ? ”
The young kid sat on the sofa as he smiled while talking to Cheng An@@ ya . He had not heard from his mom@@ my in a long time . He really missed her voice .
“ Not the s@@ lightest bit . ”
Cheng An@@ ya col@@ dly har@@ rum@@ ph@@ ed and sounded fierce . “ You are such a no@@ ob to take so long to find Mom@@ my . You deserve a span@@ king . ”
As N@@ ing N@@ ing thought about Xu Nu@@ o , he felt tigh@@ tness in his chest and smiled instead . “ Okay , darling me will accept the span@@ king . Once we are back in Rome , you can sp@@ ank me however you want . But I really do miss you , Mom@@ my . Mom@@ my , how dare you not do@@ te on me at all ? I dis@@ like you . ”
“ I reject that dis@@ like . ”
Cheng An@@ ya smiled widely and asked wor@@ ry@@ ingly , “ Were you injured ? ”
“ N@@ ope , I am perfectly intact , so don ’ t worry , ” N@@ ing N@@ ing smiled and said . “ Mom@@ my , the plane is landing . Let ’ s talk later . ”
“ Okay . ”
The young kid turned off the communic@@ ator and Cheng An@@ ya took a mou@@ thful of warm water to warm herself . While Third Young Master Ye looked on and hoped to have a word or two with his son , the call ended before he could even have a chat with his son . He looked at Cheng An@@ ya with acc@@ using eyes amid@@ st his immense un@@ happiness .
Miss Cheng cal@@ mly ignored him while Black Eagle laughed and said , “ Third master , the plane is landing soon . You will get to see young master in a moment . ”
Third Young Master Ye , feeling he had been totally ignored , could not help but p@@ inch Miss Cheng . He said , “ That hear@@ tless ty@@ ke . ”
“ You ’ re so petty ! ”
Cheng An@@ ya s@@ col@@ ded him in laughter as she passed hot water to him . Third Young Master Ye , holding the cup that Miss Cheng gave him , drank all the remaining hot water . Some alcohol to warm the body up at this moment would be perfect .
The planes were about to soon land in a castle . Ch@@ u Li , Ye Wei , Ele@@ ven and company were all present . Once they saw that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng An@@ ya were safe , everybody heav@@ ed a sigh of relief .
“ Third brother , third s@@ is@@ ter-@@ in-law , you two look absolutely hi@@ de@@ ous … ”
Ye Wei laughed extremely care@@ freely . “ Third brother , I should take a photo of this for me@@ mento ’ s sake . ”
“ You damn l@@ ass . ”
Third Young Master Ye s@@ col@@ ded her in laughter . With Wei Wei , Ele@@ ven , and the young kid all safe , he was relieved .
How could anything else give the immense amount of relief after all that he had put in ?
The young kid wanted to hug Cheng An@@ ya , but she ordered him to stop . The young kid then realized that his mom@@ my carried the virus . Black Eagle had mentioned it , and the young kid ’ s heart slightly sank when he saw his d@@ addy and mom@@ my hold hands .
“ Daddy , Mom@@ my , you are all … Ba@@ i Ye , please quickly check them up . ”
The young kid ’ s first reaction was to look for Ba@@ i Ye . As he was a genius doctor , there was nothing he could not cure .
“ Got it , got it . Don ’ t worry . ”
Ba@@ i Ye smiled .
“ Virus ? ”
A handsome d@@ ude with gold hair and blue eyes blin@@ ked . “ Dear stupid , isn ’ t this your strength ? ”
Stu@@ p@@ id ?
Ba@@ i Ye fle@@ xed his w@@ ris@@ ts and broke into a d@@ ashing and gentle smile . “ Jason , wanna try calling me stupid again ? ”
“ … F * * * ! What ’ s wrong with calling you stupid ? You are all along stupid , and how dare you call Black J the Iron . ”
Jason , who was known for his fi@@ ery tongue was also un@@ believ@@ ably handsome , l@@ ashed out at them like a gol@@ d-@@ man@@ e lion .
His sk@@ y-@@ blue eyes were as bright as sap@@ phire .
When he flew into a rage , he eman@@ ated a wave of ch@@ illing anger that was akin to a volcano erup@@ ting . His dom@@ ine@@ ering stre@@ ak was clearly visible .
To the side , Black J was a Chinese-@@ English mix@@ ed-@@ blood male in his tw@@ en@@ ties who had extremely delicate features . His features had a mys@@ ter@@ i@@ ousness Ori@@ ent@@ als had , and also had the deep@@ ness the W@@ ester@@ ners had . He had a pair of gr@@ ay@@ -@@ blue eyes that seemed slightly blur@@ ry and gave people the wrong impression of him being deeply passionate . On closer observation , he was extremely keen and had deeply concealed intro@@ version .
The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization were not old and had interesting personalities . Their a@@ ura was so strong , as though they ruled over the world . This was despite the three major leaders of the group being present .
As one looked at them , visual dis@@ son@@ ance stood out .
“ Jason , you sure need a lesson . ”
Ele@@ ven col@@ dly har@@ rum@@ ph@@ ed . “ What ’ s with calling him stupid ? Wal@@ lo@@ p him . ”
Ye Wei looked at them and shook her head . “ Third brother , third s@@ is@@ ter-@@ in-law , ignore them . Get a hot water shower before the check@@ up lest you fall sick . ”
She bec@@ k@@ oned the ma@@ id@@ servants to bring Ye Chen and Cheng An@@ ya for a shower . While the young kid wanted to follow along , he had to stay here . Just as Ba@@ i Ye was about to wal@@ lo@@ p somebody , the young kid quickly grabbed his collar .
“ Ba@@ i Ye , do you have a way to save my d@@ addy and mom@@ my ? ”
The child ’ s eyes were like two black grapes embedded in his tender face , extremely bright and filled with hope . Once Ba@@ i Ye shook his head , the brightness in his gaze dim@@ med .
Jason , in one fell sw@@ oop , sw@@ o@@ oped the young kid into his embrace and grand@@ ly said , “ Dear child , relax . M@@ ister Stu@@ p@@ id can save even the dead , let alone somebody alive . Why worry then ? When you are free , help me level the M@@ af@@ ia ’ s def@@ enses . ”
“ Who had just doub@@ ted Ba@@ i Ye ’ s medical skills ? ”
Black J expressed his doubts . Jason ’ s sla@@ p came over , and he def@@ tly avoided it .
The young kid , who was being hug@@ ged by a tall guy , felt extremely conflic@@ ted . He kicked Jason and said , “ Let me down . ”
“ Dam@@ n it , I want such a son too . N@@ ing N@@ ing , would you want to be my son ? Ge@@ e , I ’ ve been cra@@ ving for you for a ta@@ d too long , ” Jason said as emotions sur@@ ged in his eyes . It was as though the young kid was like a piece of meat to be s@@ avo@@ red .
Everybody was stun@@ ned into silence .
Ba@@ i Ye smiled and said , “ Jason , please have your mom@@ my brush up your man@@ dar@@ in and stop bl@@ aming Commander for his poor choice of words . You are … no better off . ”
“ Commander and I are of different le@@ agues , okay ? ”
Jason was extremely unhappy that people consistently associated him with Commander . This was a problem of principle . Good men and band@@ its were never family .
The young kid struggled and Jason put him down . The young kid asked , “ Ba@@ i Ye … ”
“ N@@ ing N@@ ing , I can only be certain after I have checked them . Do not panic for now , ” Ba@@ i Ye said as he gently rub@@ bed his hand on the young kid ’ s face . “ You ’ ve my promise that I ’ ll do all that I can . ”
The young kid had just lost Xu Nu@@ o . Now that his parents ’ fate was in the balance , he felt un@@ easy however calm he was . He could not afford to lose his parents , and Ba@@ i Ye clearly understood how he felt .
“ Don ’ t worry too much , ” Ba@@ i Ye said .
Ye Wei said , “ That should settle it . Once Ba@@ i Ye is on the case , there is no problem in the world he cannot solve . If Louis can develop such a virus , there must be an anti@@ do@@ te somewhere . If Ba@@ i Ye can ’ t solve that problem , he ought to be stripped of his title . ”
Ch@@ u Li smiled and said , “ Agreed . ”
“ Dear stupid , do you have a title ? ”
Jason asked with some doubt . He had no idea what title Ba@@ i Ye had .
Ele@@ ven wanted to wal@@ lo@@ p him with a punch .
“ That said , why didn ’ t the two of you manage to capture Louis ? ”
Black J asked . “ The earlier this s@@ coun@@ dre@@ l dies , the earlier our minds are at ease . ”
“ I ’ ve long wanted to waste that ass@@ wipe . Given how the M@@ af@@ ia has been starting conflicts all around recently , this guy has to be sufficiently terrible to wax and wan@@ e when his headquarters has been level@@ ed . ”
“ As for Louis , let ’ s not has@@ ten , ” the young kid slowly said as his face broke into a dangerous smile and a schem@@ ing intent showed through his eyes . “ To win without fighting is the ideal situation , and our personal ven@@ det@@ ta with him another thing . That said , the tur@@ f war between the M@@ af@@ ia and terrorists is another thing .
If we want to eliminate the M@@ af@@ ia , we will have to incur a massive financial cost and material burden .
Following his recent engagement with us , his position in the M@@ af@@ ia would be precarious . I ’ ve long suspected that there is a power center in the M@@ af@@ ia that is hidden from plain sight , which explains why Louis ’ su@@ ic@@ idal maneu@@ ver was halted . Since that is the case , let ’ s allow Louis to take the lead , fish out this power center , and take them out in one fell sw@@ oop . ”
How schem@@ ing indeed …
That was everybody ’ s senti@@ ments .
Although he was typically schem@@ ing and de@@ vious , people would excessively do@@ te on him given his extremely young age . That , added to how tender he looked , often caused people to over@@ look what he was capable of .
“ Sch@@ em@@ ing ! ”
Jason said as he gave a thumb@@ s-@@ up . He was the one who was quicker to take action and contemplated much less than the others . He would , more often than not , go with Black@@ jack and Ch@@ u Li ’ s plans .
He always yielded to the young kid ’ s plans .
To have formidable bra@@ in@@ power behind a group of action-@@ tak@@ ers made for an extremely terri@@ fying force .
“ I agree with N@@ ing N@@ ing ’ s thoughts , ” Ch@@ u Li said . He and Ba@@ i Ye agreed with N@@ ing N@@ ing ’ s thoughts . “ Let ’ s settle everything once and for all lest people forget their place and consistently start a fight . It is not too bad an idea . ”
“ When did I ever re@@ but N@@ ing N@@ ing ? Ge@@ e , we are always in ca@@ hoo@@ ts with each other . ”
Black J laughed . “ This time , however , we ought to teach the M@@ af@@ ia a lesson so that they will stay out of our path even after fifty years from now . ”
Ba@@ i Ye nodded as he had no opinion . He wanted to understand the virus that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng An@@ ya carried . That was critical . Ch@@ u Li could handle everything else .
Ye Wei and Ele@@ ven looked each other in the eye . What was this other ‘ power center ’ ?
A familiar face appeared in both their minds . Was it M@@ o Ye and M@@ o J@@ ue ?
In the M@@ af@@ ia , they were the only ones who had sufficient cl@@ out and yet mysterious . They could not figure out anyone else save them who had the char@@ is@@ ma . Since they were le@@ agues above Louis , there was no reason they would listen to him .
As everyone else moved toward the living room , the young kid went to look for Cheng An@@ ya , who happened to have had her shower and had a cup of hot tea . Her body was warm and her cheeks were slightly ros@@ y . She sat on the bed and slowly pon@@ dered about something as she looked at her fingers .
“ Mom@@ my … ”
The young kid opened the door and entered , smiling as he walked toward her .
Cheng An@@ ya turned around and win@@ ked . She praised him and said , “ Dar@@ ling , you are sure top-class . ”
He was , in his dress , really aw@@ es@@ om@@ e-@@ looking and seemed nowhere near a child . He was simply a dangerous person .
“ Thank you for the p@@ raises , Mom@@ my . ”
“ Don ’ t come close and sit further away . I ’ m afraid that I could not help it but sp@@ ank you . ”
Cheng An@@ ya smiled as she pointed toward the sofa . “ S@@ it around there . ”
The young kid stared at Cheng An@@ ya an@@ gr@@ ily . “ Mom@@ my , you are desp@@ ising me . ”
“ Indeed . ”
Cheng An@@ ya smiled as she looked at the young kid in the eye . She felt that this kid had changed in some way . Although he looked no different from before , mothers , however , understood their child best . Whatever changes the child went , and however well-@@ hidden they were , she could somewhat sense it .
“ Mom@@ my , why are you looking at me like this ? Don ’ t you think that I am properly handsome ? ”
The young kid play@@ fully blin@@ ked his eyes . He looked extremely ador@@ able .
Cheng An@@ ya looked at him with a seem@@ ing smile and said , “ You have taken quite a leaf from your d@@ addy ’ s nar@@ c@@ iss@@ istic stre@@ ak . That said , have you been okay this while ? Be honest to Mom@@ my , okay ? Were you bul@@ lied ? ”
The young kid shook his head and said , “ No . ”
“ Non@@ sense . Louis showed me a photo of you clearly beaten and bloo@@ died . ”
Cheng An@@ ya did not believe and said through gr@@ itted teeth , “ Even if he is ev@@ is@@ cer@@ ated thousand times over , it won ’ t ease the hate in me . ”
As she recalled what she had experienced , Cheng An@@ ya deeply hated Louis .
There was a ven@@ eer of col@@ dness across her bright face , and she had an even worse pre@@ mon@@ ition when she thought about what the young kid had experienced .
“ Mom@@ my , I really am fine . The photo was most likely edited . ”
The young kid ele@@ gan@@ tly smiled and rolled up his sle@@ eves to show a white and tender arm . “ See , no injuries . ”
As the bullet wound on his arm had largely recovered and quickly , he was not afraid of Cheng An@@ ya discovering it at all .
And the l@@ ashes that he suffered were because of Xu Nu@@ o . Since Xu Nu@@ o was the person who scour@@ ged him , he did not feel that he was bul@@ lied . Instead , he missed the pain when she wall@@ oped him before .
If Nu@@ o Nu@@ o were still alive , he didn ’ t mind her wall@@ oping him all day long .
“ N@@ ing N@@ ing , are you really okay ? ”
Cheng An@@ ya f@@ row@@ ned . She did not miss the hint of pain that fl@@ ashed through her son ’ s eyes .
The young kid nodded and said , “ I am really fine . Mom@@ my , Daddy and you are in a ru@@ t . Uncle Black Eagle mentioned that you have caught a virus . How did Daddy catch it too ? ”
As Cheng An@@ ya recalled a hor@@ ny Third Young Master Ye , she could not help but bl@@ ush and had no desire to mention what happened . “ Don ’ t ask . We had jumped out of a plane once over the desert , and another time over the ocean . How could we not contact each other ? ”
Miss Cheng replied cal@@ mly and the young kid did not doubt her .
“ Mom@@ my , do not worry . You two will be saved by Ba@@ i Ye ’ s top-@@ no@@ tch medical skills . ”
The moment Blu@@ es@@ il@@ ver Golden Ar@@ ray activated , the flames grew dim . Then the array suc@@ ked all of the flames up !
But the fl@@ aming g@@ our@@ d wouldn ’ t be defeated so easily . It turned its mouth up a bit and spe@@ wed yet another burst of fire , roc@@ keting itself out of the golden array ’ s domain .
All of this happened in the bl@@ ink of an eye !
She ’ s a tough one ! Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s expression hardened .
They needed to defeat her as soon as possible , otherwise the enfor@@ c@@ ers would arrive to back her up .
The g@@ our@@ d ro@@ tated downward and e@@ jected the woman in a fi@@ ery bl@@ aze . F@@ ury filled her eyes . “ What the hell are you kids doing ? ”
Before she could continue questioning them , golden light fl@@ ashed beneath her and her body went stiff .
Tang W@@ ul@@ in took advantage of this opening and commanded his blu@@ es@@ il@@ ver grass to bind her . Ye Xing@@ lan then rushed in and thrust her sword at the woman ’ s chest . X@@ ie X@@ ie took action as well , appearing behind the woman and swi@@ ping his Light Dragon D@@ ag@@ ger at her neck .
Their movements were in perfect sync !
Against a single opponent , there was nothing better than Xu Xiao@@ yan ’ s Star@@ wheel Sh@@ ack@@ les .
Its power was absolute !
Just when they thought they had defeated the woman , the Star@@ god S@@ word and Light Dragon D@@ ag@@ ger inches from taking her life , the woman ’ s eyes fl@@ ashed and a pho@@ en@@ ix ’ s cry pi@@ er@@ ced the air .
Fi@@ ery light g@@ low@@ ed beneath her clothing , bur@@ sting forth to en@@ velop her entire body in an instant . R@@ ings of light appeared all over her body , and with it , the intensity of her soul power fluctuations sur@@ ged to an even higher level .
She was several times stronger than before , her soul power manifes@@ ting around her as a giant ring of flames . A golden pattern appeared on the g@@ our@@ d above her , and it grew to two feet diameter .
The flames around her forced Ye Xing@@ lan and X@@ ie X@@ ie away from her , then continued to ling@@ er on their bodies and feed on their soul power .
The pho@@ en@@ ix ’ s cry continued to grow stronger . The woman stood up straight . She began to ex@@ ude an air of gran@@ de@@ ur as a cr@@ im@@ son set of armor manifested to cover her entire body .
A pho@@ en@@ ix hel@@ met materi@@ alized into being , sn@@ ug on her head . Cr@@ im@@ son body armor traced the elegant sil@@ hou@@ ette of her wom@@ an@@ ly figure . Ve@@ ins of fire spread from her shoulders to her finger@@ tips .
A fi@@ ery golden pho@@ en@@ ix embl@@ em was en@@ grav@@ ed onto her breast@@ plate . The armor itself wasn ’ t particularly beautiful , but it emphasized her wom@@ an@@ ly charm and elevated it to another level .
Tang W@@ ul@@ in spu@@ t@@ tered . Then a bitter smile formed on his lips .
From the complexity of the design and the strength of power fluctuations , Tang W@@ ul@@ in knew she was wearing one-@@ word battle armor . She had used the rings of light from earlier as a method of storage .
Normal one-@@ word armor couldn ’ t merge with the user after all .
Yet this was a full set of one-@@ word battle armor !
This five-@@ r@@ inged woman now possessed might comparable to that of a seven-@@ r@@ inged soul master !
Yan Feng was fur@@ ious right now . She had been in a good mood when she set out for the Spirit P@@ ago@@ da this morning to register as a one-@@ word battle armor master .
She was the youngest one-@@ word battle armor master in Heaven Spirit City , and this gave her the leverage to sign a re@@ tainer contract with great benefits .
The Spirit P@@ ago@@ da promised to invest in her and bring her up to the two-@@ word level , upon which she could be considered a powerful figure on the continent .
Yet right after she left the Spirit P@@ ago@@ da bu@@ z@@ zing with joy , she was am@@ bush@@ ed by a bunch of kids !
These kids weren ’ t weak either , and they managed to force her to bring out her battle armor .
She couldn ’ t possibly have known that Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s gang meant no harm , and she had felt genuinely threatened by the Star@@ god S@@ word and Light Dragon D@@ ag@@ ger .
The moment Yan Feng brought out her battle armor , Wu Zhang@@ kong ’ s voice rang in the ears of everyone in Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s group . “ If you are able to defeat her , you will fulfill the quota for this city . ”
Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s mouth tw@@ it@@ ched . Teacher Wu , oh Teacher Wu ! How could you do this to us !
She ’ s a one-@@ word battle armor master ! She ’ s as strong as a seven-@@ r@@ inged Soul S@@ age ! How are we supposed to defeat someone like that ?
Before Tang W@@ ul@@ in could continue his train of thought , Yan Feng pointed at Tang W@@ ul@@ in and the g@@ our@@ d expelled flames toward him .
I can ’ t talk her down anymore ! Tang W@@ ul@@ in could see the in@@ extingu@@ ishable fur@@ y in her eyes .
They could only give it their all . We have no other choice !
Tang W@@ ul@@ in suc@@ ked in a deep breath even as the flames flew at him . His three purple soul rings disappeared , and in an instant , they were replaced by a single golden one . Golden light erupted from him as scales rip@@ pled into existence to cover his right arm , and his hand transformed into a dragon cl@@ aw . Th@@ reads of star@@ light shot out of his hand and wrapped themselves around it , manifes@@ ting as a ga@@ un@@ t@@ let .
He couldn ’ t afford to hold back against a real battle armor master !
“ Battle armor ? ”
Yan Feng was star@@ tled by the ga@@ un@@ t@@ let on Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s cl@@ aw . Im@@ possible !
He ’ s so young !
There ’ s no way he could have a piece of battle armor ! It came from within his body too ! Could it actually be a piece of two-@@ word armor ?
Even though it was just a one-@@ word ga@@ un@@ t@@ let , it was un@@ th@@ ink@@ able for such a young kid to have it .
Yan Feng got her first piece of battle armor when was twenty-@@ one years old , and she was considered a genius for it .
She had been hard at work these past few years and finally managed to craft a full set .
Yet Tang W@@ ul@@ in was years ahead of her .
The instant Tang W@@ ul@@ in made his move , so too did his comr@@ ades .
Posi@@ tioned in the back@@ line , Xu L@@ iz@@ hi did the only thing he could do . He threw soup bun@@ s and bean bun@@ s to the others .
Tang W@@ ul@@ in caught it the bun@@ s from behind with his left hand and immediately ate them .
He had to finish this as soon as possible .
Even one-@@ word battle armor possessed the ability to boost its user ’ s soul power recovery .
A prolonged battle guaranteed defeat for them .
Tang W@@ ul@@ in stom@@ ped the ground with his left foot and shot forward , shat@@ tering the ground below . His blood essence boiling as the power of the Golden Dragon King sur@@ ged within him . His eyes became a res@@ pl@@ end@@ ent gold , and the op@@ pressive a@@ ura of his blood essence co@@ al@@ es@@ ced .
Bran@@ dish@@ ing his dragon cl@@ aw , he sw@@ ung it in front of him and split the incoming flames apart , opening a path to Yan Feng .
As the captain of his team and an assa@@ ul@@ t-@@ type soul master , it was Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s duty to lead the charge . He couldn ’ t shrink back in the face of an opponent . He had to create an opening for his comr@@ ades .
His blood essence and soul power sky@@ roc@@ keted under the influence of the blood@@ thirst bean bun@@ s . Golden scales covered his entire body now , but sh@@ one brigh@@ test on his right arm and tor@@ so .
He has twin martial souls ?
Yan Feng went wide-@@ eyed with shock . But only for a moment .
“ H@@ mph ! ”
She gla@@ red at Tang W@@ ul@@ in and stood her ground . The g@@ our@@ d above her turned from Tang W@@ ul@@ in to his comr@@ ades , spe@@ wing flames to isolate him .
She wanted to deal with the enemy leader first .
Yan Feng met Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s golden dragon cl@@ aw with a f@@ ist of her own .
The instant before the two col@@ li@@ ded , a dr@@ ac@@ onic ro@@ ar erupted from Tang W@@ ul@@ in ’ s body . A golden dragon head half a meter in diameter shot out of his f@@ ist and toward Yan Feng ’ s !
It was Golden Dragon Sh@@ ocks the He@@ aven@@ s !
Tang W@@ ul@@ in may not have broken the fourth seal after eating the ru@@ by shr@@ imp , but they had still boos@@ ted his power and refined his control over Golden Dragon Sh@@ ocks the He@@ aven@@ s !
Al@@ arms went off in Yan Feng ’ s head . She sens@@ ed a powerful force suddenly appear in front of her , then her flames were dev@@ oured . The golden cl@@ aw opened up and clam@@ ped down on her f@@ ist .
Tang W@@ ul@@ in tigh@@ tened his grip on Yan Feng ’ s f@@ ist , and her battle armor fla@@ red up in defense , all of the fi@@ ery veins on her armor bl@@ azing to life . The pho@@ en@@ ix embl@@ em g@@ low@@ ed and a transparent pho@@ en@@ ix shot out at him .
Fang Zhao was basically set on the house after scrutin@@ izing it carefully without finding any major issues . All that remained was for Nan@@ feng to negotiate with the real estate agent and the owner .
Cur@@ ly Hair was in a very good mood today and enjoyed himself thoroughly when he was let loose .
After Fang Zhao called him ash@@ ore , he continued playing around in the sand . When they were finally leaving , Cur@@ ly Hair stared long@@ ingly out the car window .
Nan@@ feng ch@@ uck@@ led when he saw this . “ Don ’ t worry Cur@@ ly Hair , you ’ ll be moving in the next time we come . You ’ ll be able to play as much as you want and swim in the ocean every day . There are even small fish and aquatic creatures to play with . ”
Cur@@ ly Hair was delighted and laid down to envisage his blessed future life .
What sort of impression did Cur@@ ly Hair have of the ocean ?
An image of a free seafood buffet .
His cheerful mood persisted all the way until they returned back to the advanced students ’ dormitory .
After Nan@@ feng and the other two left , Fang Zhao shut his dor@@ m door . “ Come here , Cur@@ ly Hair . ”
Cur@@ ly Hair w@@ agged his tail and went over .
“ Did you enjoy playing today ? ”
Fang Zhao asked .
“ Wo@@ of ! ”
“ Did you have fun there ? ”
Fang Zhao asked again .
Cur@@ ly Hair le@@ aped up and bar@@ ked again . He w@@ agged his tail vigorously .
“ Speak . ”
“ Fun ! ”
Cur@@ ly Hair replied .
He had already gotten used to switching languages already , and his pronunciation was rather smooth now .
“ M@@ m@@ hm . ”
Fang Zhao nodded , then turned on the learning console .
Cur@@ ly Hair : “ … ”
His ears sh@@ ud@@ dered and he shr@@ ank back a step .
Fang Zhao ignored Cur@@ ly Hair ’ s retreat . He turned on the learning console and opened a file for Cur@@ ly Hair . Inside the file were e-@@ books that he had purchased for Cur@@ ly Hair .
“ Ocean Environment Protection Law ”
“ Environmental Conservation Series For Young Adults ”
“ Protected Marine Cre@@ atures List ”
“ Marine Environmental Management ”
“ 100 Facts About The Ocean That New Er@@ a People Need To Under@@ stand ”
“ The Ocean , My Home ”
There was a total of twenty books . All of them were related to the ocean .
On top of that , there were twenty sets of test questions as well .
Cur@@ ly Hair : “ … ”
His trembling ears dro@@ oped down .
“ I know you read fast . You ought to be even faster now , right ? ”
“ After you finish reading the twenty books in the file and get full marks for all twenty sets of test questions , I will let you out to play in the ocean . ”
“ By my estimates , there are probably less than fifteen days before we can move in , ” Fang Zhao said .
This was all knowledge that could be memor@@ ized . Given Cur@@ ly Hair ’ s current memory and learning ability , obtaining full marks wasn ’ t a difficult task .
Fang Zhao wasn ’ t worried about Cur@@ ly Hair ’ s safety when he went out into the ocean . On the contrary , he was worried that Cur@@ ly Hair would eat up and eradicate endangered marine creatures .
Even now , Fang Zhao didn ’ t know exactly how big Cur@@ ly Hair ’ s stomach was .
During the filming on Planet B@@ u , Cur@@ ly Hair was secretly eating a lot of other creatures in the desert and the sea . It was only because of Fang Zhao ’ s warning that Cur@@ ly Hair didn ’ t really go all out and eat .
After all , his time in Planet B@@ u wasn ’ t very long , and Fang Zhao had given him restrictions . He also had to be careful of being seen by other people on Planet B@@ u and hadn ’ t been able to eat too much in secret .
However , after moving into the new place , Cur@@ ly Hair would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day . No matter what restrictions were in place , this single dog would be an invasive force that would wrec@@ k the marine ecosystem in that area .
Fang Zhao had to get Cur@@ ly Hair to understand certain things beforehand . It hadn ’ t been easy for the marine life to recover to the current levels of today . It couldn ’ t be destroyed by Cur@@ ly Hair .
For@@ get about playing in the ocean if you don ’ t get full marks ! There ’ ll only be the learning console for you !
On a certain day , Nan@@ feng came to look for Fang Zhao regarding the renov@@ ations of the new place .
Upon entering the dormitory , Nan@@ feng saw Cur@@ ly Hair facing the wall with a dro@@ oped head . There were tear sta@@ ins beneath his dog eyes .
Nan@@ feng paused for a moment , then looked away and went to find Fang Zhao . He had to settle the matters at hand first .
Besides , this was normal behavior from Cur@@ ly Hair . Nan@@ feng had already gotten used to it and could remain calm when seeing this .
After discussing the renovation issue , Nan@@ feng recalled something he had seen today and asked , “ Oh , right . Boss , did you see the stuff online today ? ”
“ What stuff ? ”
Fang Zhao had been writing a thesis today and had set his personal terminal to “ Do not disturb ” .
There was a lot of talk online regarding Fang Zhao . Many people were looking for him . Thus , Fang Zhao could only use the “ Do not disturb ” mode .
“ Do you know about Will ’ s painting ? ”
Nan@@ feng asked .
“ Yeah , is it regarding Will ’ s graduation works ? ”
Fang Zhao had gone to see Will ’ s graduation exhibition already . Will too had gotten a high A + evaluation . A@@ mon@@ g@@ st his graduation pieces was a painting of Cur@@ ly Hair titled “ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” .
The exhibition had already ended two days ago . Furthermore , because Fang Zhao had been working on a thesis in his dormitory since morning , he really wasn ’ t aware of the online news .
Nan@@ feng told Fang Zhao what he knew .
It turned out that after Will ’ s graduation exhibition had concluded , the school had displayed his art pieces on the school ’ s website . This had gar@@ nered a lot of discussion .
Will had successfully both of his goals set last year from his advanced student plan . His short-term objective had been to paint Fang Zhao . His final objective had been to paint Fang Zhao ’ s dog .
His short-term objective had long been completed . Back then , Will ’ s painting of “ My Neigh@@ bor ” had generated quite some bu@@ zz online . There were even ne@@ tiz@@ ens jo@@ king that Will had painted Fang Zhao like an alien .
Following “ My Neigh@@ bor ” , “ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” became a tren@@ ding search on that day .
“ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” was the art piece that Will had spent the most time and effort on during his advanced studies period . At the same time , it was also the piece Will was most satisfied with .
This painting had a similar style to the previous “ My Neigh@@ bor ” , but it was even more difficult to interpret . One could still make out a human form when viewing “ My Neigh@@ bor ” , but “ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” didn ’ t seem in any way like a dog . If not for the title of this piece , nobody would think that the dog in this painting was a little pet dog .
The vivid colors were both mysterious and imposing , They pushed the boundaries of the ordinary . But , there seemed to be something off . The longer one looked at it , the more ap@@ prehensive one would feel .
“ Is Fang Zhao ’ s dog really that terri@@ fying ? ”
A Huang@@ Art student thought back to when he had encountered that cur@@ ly ha@@ ired dog in the school ’ s garden . He then went to do a quick online search of Fang Zhao ’ s dog . Indeed , he hadn ’ t remembered wrong@@ ly .
Over at Huang@@ Art , those who had attended Fang Zhao ’ s graduation concert and also viewed Will ’ s painting up close had other thoughts .
“ I must say , the feeling I get from this painting is similar to what I felt from Fang Zhao ’ s song ‘ η ’ . ”
“ It seems to sur@@ pass ordinary people ’ s scope of comprehen@@ sion . ”
Even industry out@@ siders standing before the painting and observing it silently for a few seconds felt e@@ erie sens@@ ations . Even though they didn ’ t understand , they still shi@@ vered .
On the Internet , the discussions became even more intense .
“ Will has really let loose after entering advanced studies . His thoughts and ideology are free-@@ flying . It ’ s no longer something we can understand . ”
“ What sort of gr@@ udge does he have to actually paint Fang Zhao ’ s dog in such a way ? ! ”
“ OP definitely hasn ’ t seen Will ’ s previous painting ‘ My Neigh@@ bor ’ . First go see how Will painted Fang Zhao before you try to understand it . ”
“ Perhaps Will was b@@ itten by a dog before and has a psychological scar . Otherwise , why would he have painted it in such a terri@@ fying light ? ! ”
“ A little cu@@ tie has been turned into a monster ! ”
“ This is called art . ”
“ Indeed , ordinary people like us aren ’ t able to understand an artist ’ s world . ”
“ Objec@@ tively speaking , after staring at it for a whole five minutes , I am still unable to dec@@ i@@ ph@@ er what it is that he wants to express . However , I undoubtedly feel that is impressive despite the weird sensation . ”
“ This probably classi@@ fies as a more abstract art which requires more metic@@ ulous viewing . ”
“ This painting wouldn ’ t sell well , right ? ”
“ It can be purchased to ward off evil spirits too . ”
“ I think it ’ s worthwhile as an investment . This artist Will is still young . ”
In actu@@ ality , Will had already received some inquiries about purchasing the painting after it was displayed on the school ’ s website .
Finally , it was a collector from Mu@@ zhou who bought “ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” . His bid far exceeded Huang@@ Art ’ s estimated valuation .
Some people reck@@ oned that this Mu@@ zhou collector was overly crazy about Cur@@ ly Hair . After all , many Mu@@ zhou people couldn ’ t stay calm when it came to Cur@@ ly hair .
There were also some who felt that this was purely h@@ ype , whether because of Will or because of Fang Zhao ’ s dog . The way that Mu@@ zhou people viewed dogs could be impossible to understand sometimes .
Thus , Huang@@ zhou TV Station ’ s painting and call@@ igraphy channel specially dispatched someone to interview the person who had bought this painting .
During the interview , the Mu@@ zhou collector said , “ Many people that buy Will ’ s paintings invest in the artist Will and not the painting . ”
“ I am different because what I look at is both the painting and the dog in the painting . ”
“ I have a hun@@ ch that this painting ’ s value will sky@@ rocket in the future . ”
Little Bear was watching the interview broadcast . “ Mu@@ zhou people really have a fear@@ some intu@@ ition towards dogs . ”
“ Hum@@ ans are indeed peculiar creatures . ”
Thus , because of Will ’ s painting “ My Neigh@@ bor ’ s Dog ” , Cur@@ ly Hair too became a ho@@ tly searched topic and appeared on Huang@@ zhou ’ s tren@@ ding head@@ lines .
After Nan@@ feng left , Fang Zhao brow@@ sed through the news online and said to Cur@@ ly Hair , “ You can forget about going out these few days . Stand for another five minutes before going back to hit the books . ”
“ You only scored 62 for the morning ’ s test . Go read through the section of protected animals twice more ! ”
“ Can wh@@ ales be eaten ? ! ”
“ You can ’ t eat cor@@ als either ! ”
“ Just to show you around to get a hang of the energy per@@ turb@@ ation . It ’ s very simple , ” a sor@@ cere@@ r could not help but ch@@ ime in , smiling .
“ Thank you . ”
Lin Sh@@ eng nodded at him .
He needed to find the other fragments quickly . He had thought of conqu@@ ering more dark spirits to get more pure soul power .
But since he got this opportunity , he was more than happy to take my offer .
The head of the sor@@ cere@@ rs brought Lin Sh@@ eng at one Dark@@ spirit Gate .
They both reached out their hands , touching the frame of the gate with eyes closed .
With his special ability , the head of the sor@@ cere@@ r started to build a dimensional base for coordinate confirmation .
Following that , the ritual per@@ turb@@ ation of the Dark@@ spirit Gate was transmitted together with Lin Sh@@ eng ’ s conscious perception .
“ An ordinary tele@@ portation ritual is poin@@ t-@@ to-@@ point transmission . ”
“ But when we explore other dimensional real@@ ms , we change it to become one-@@ to-@@ multi@@ ple-@@ point transmission . ”
“ What we need to do is to make some minor changes to the parameters on the transmission base . ”
The head of the sor@@ cere@@ rs was guiding Lin Sh@@ eng ’ s consciousness as he taught him the technique .
“ This way , the Dark@@ spirit Gate will spon@@ taneously transmit our consciousness into multiple targe@@ t-@@ dimensions . ”
“ It is the luck of the draw . If we get lucky , we might b@@ ump into the dimensional realm we are looking for . If we get no luck , just try a few more times . ”
“ That ’ s random enough , though . ”
Lin Sh@@ eng was d@@ umb@@ founded .
The ritual instantly per@@ tur@@ bed his perception the minute he stepped into the Dark@@ spirit Gate , wrap@@ ping it inside as it spread out .
At the same time , his consciousness seemed to break apart , his perception split into a dozen tiny pieces , feeling the energy in a dozen different dimensions .
“ Generally , we can ’ t keep our consciousness in one piece during the transmission . We can only try to remember as best as we can the dimensional coordinates we came across . ”
“ We need to leave a simple mark on the coordinates … ”
Outside , the sor@@ cere@@ r chief kept doing the explaining , guiding Lin Sh@@ eng how to create the simple marking in determining the coordinate code .
But one thing he had not expected ; Lin Sh@@ eng ’ s consciousness was so strong that he could memor@@ ize all the coordinates of the dimensions that his consciousness pieces came into .
To Lin Sh@@ eng , it was just a matter of multi@@ tas@@ king , a skill that he had been training for every day .
He could use his split consciousness to direct and observe his every summoned creature , although he could not independently control them at the same time .
Memor@@ izing the per@@ turb@@ ation and determining the coordinates were just a walk in the park .
His strong soul played a part and he could stay for a longer time .
Ten minutes later , the split consciousness dissip@@ ated .
Lin Sh@@ eng opened his eyes , looking at the sor@@ cere@@ r chief and others .
Their eyes were on stal@@ ks as he told them a specific coordinate of a special dimensional realm .
This realm was the one hom@@ olog@@ ous to the Dark Wheel frag@@ ment he carried .
“ You got it the first time ? ”
The sor@@ cere@@ r chief could not believe that he heard . He had spent over two months to find and record the coordinate when he sens@@ ed the dimensional energy for the first time .
“ It ’ s a simple process . ”
“ Let ’ s build the portal . ”
“ I need to go there quickly , ” Lin Sh@@ eng instructed .
“ A@@ ye . ”
“ Wait for me . ”
Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi spoke to him through tele@@ pathy . He fro@@ ze .
“ What ’ s up ? ”
He went to one side , watching as the sor@@ cere@@ r chief started to direct the dark spirits moving the materials .
“ There is a situation here in Vis@@ aca Island ! ”
Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi ’ s voice sounded grave .
It was a phenomenon that Lin Sh@@ eng had never seen before .
Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi had never been this depressed , even when Lin Sh@@ eng told her about the existence of the Night Lord last time .
This made Lin Sh@@ eng a little nervous .
“ Is M@@ i Y@@ ue at an absolute disadvantage ? ”
Lin Sh@@ eng f@@ row@@ ned .
“ Or are there some new forces joining the battle ? ”
“ No . Not new forces , ” Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi said .
“ It ’ s M@@ i Y@@ ue ; he had decei@@ ved everyone ! ”
“ What ? ”
“ The Seven@@ locks Tower has been successful with the summon@@ ing . M@@ i Y@@ ue has decei@@ ved everyone in the three mysterious real@@ ms . He has successfully summoned Fal@@ dt , using himself as a sacrifice to make himself as one with it ! ”
It took a while before that sank in .
“ Using himself as a sacrifice ? ”
“ That mad@@ man ! ”
“ So what the three mysterious real@@ ms face now is a hybrid monster of M@@ i Y@@ ue and Fal@@ dt . ”
Lin Sh@@ eng was speech@@ less .
“ What should we do now ? ”
Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi asked .
The combination of Fal@@ dt and M@@ i Y@@ ue was not as simple as 1 + 1 = 2 ; it was 3 × 10 .
“ Cal@@ m down . ”
“ The three mysterious real@@ ms and other forces are still M@@ i Y@@ ue and Fal@@ dt ’ s biggest enemies . ”
“ There is more to this world than meets the eye . ”
The thought of his previous investigation came to mind .
“ The Astr@@ al M@@ ere and those having the Sac@@ red Ves@@ sel of Des@@ tiny are no sl@@ ou@@ ch . ”
“ We will not interfere with what they do so long as they don ’ t interfere with ours . ”
“ I got what you meant . ”
“ But we had better be prepared , ” Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi said .
“ I used to possess that destructive power when I was controlled by the Demon@@ blade . ”
“ That ’ s why I know what that kind of power could do . ”
Lin Sh@@ eng was keeping silent .
Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi was his most special commander because some power was used to control her .
At that time , when she traced back her memories , she discovered that Lin Sh@@ eng had been pe@@ eping at her .
Just through an image im@@ print in the memories , she knew that Lin Sh@@ eng was observing her .
Such a powerful ability was beyond the apprehen@@ sion of Lin Sh@@ eng .
“ I got it , ” Lin Sh@@ eng said .
“ I will be prepared . ”
“ Don ’ t worry . ”
If worse comes to worst , he could activate his special state of being by summon@@ ing all the commanders to become one with him .
He cut off the tele@@ path@@ ic communication with Ten@@ ko Kas@@ umi , quietly staring at the newly constructed Dark@@ spirit Gate as his thoughts came back to the matter at hand .
“ It is ready , My Lord , ” the sor@@ cere@@ r chief said .
Lin Sh@@ eng gaz@@ ed at the portal and remained silent for a while .
“ Ask for the Fair@@ y King and Dj@@ all ! ”
Dj@@ all Demon@@ hand had been put on standby in the vicinity .
Hearing the sum@@ mon , he stro@@ de in through the doorway .
“ At your service , My Lord . ”
Lin Sh@@ eng nodded at him .
“ I need to open multiple port@@ als to sc@@ out out multiple dar@@ k-@@ spirit dimensions . ”
“ Select one hundred great dark spirits , divide them into groups to do the rec@@ ce . ”
“ Under@@ stood ! ”
Dj@@ all Demon@@ hand looked s@@ tern , knowing that they had come to some turning point .
Otherwise , he would not have called for such a large-scale operation .
This was what Song Fu and his group wanted to ask , but having someone else ask it first , they instead looked at each other , and were clearly unaware of what was going on , so how could they answer ?
Mi@@ ao Yi immediately d@@ ashed towards the place where the loud noise originated from , and Yan Xi@@ u and his group instantly followed suit .
Song Fu ’ s group looked at each other , also following behind to see what had happened .
Everyone had reached the mountain gates , and under the moon@@ light , they could see that the large stone memorial arch that had the words ‘ East Arrival Cave ’ carved onto it was left shat@@ tered to just pieces on the ground . Everyone was shocked to find out that someone had actually destroyed the mountain gates of East Arrival Cave .
Mi@@ ao Yi suddenly turned his head , and giving Song Fu and his group a vicious look , he said col@@ dly , “ Good ! ”
“ I ’ ve just arrived today , and it seems like someone was anxious to knock me down a peg ! ”
“ Very good ! ”
Song Fu and his group were taken ab@@ ack — they understood what the other party meant , but this incident was not their doing . They ’ d just been sitting together and holding their own gathering , discussing precisely on how to teach Mi@@ ao Yi a lesson from now on , and had only run out after hearing the strange noise .
At first , they suspected whether Mi@@ ao Yi and his group were the ones that did it , but after looking at Mi@@ ao Yi ’ s reaction , they felt he had no need to destroy his own mountain gates to teach himself a lesson . After all , Mi@@ ao Yi was the East Arrival Cave Master , and having your sign destroyed right after your promotion was a very humili@@ ating affair .
They had to make things clear , otherwise if they were blamed , they wouldn ’ t be able to shoulder the responsibility . Song Fu cup@@ ped his f@@ ists and declared , “ Cave Master , this incident was definitely not our doing ! ”
The others also followed suit in cup@@ ping their f@@ ists and assuring Mi@@ ao Yi , as though it was the first time they ’ d honestly treated Mi@@ ao Yi as Cave Master .
“ L@@ ies ! ”
Mi@@ ao Yi gla@@ red at Song Fu and shouted , “ I ’ ve only just assigned you to watch the mountain gates today , how could you not be aware if someone had destroyed it ? ”
“ It can only mean you let them do it on purpose ! ”
“ This … ”
Song Fu st@@ uttered , he hadn ’ t even been there , and now was not a good time to say that he ’ d been absent from duty because he didn ’ t even regard Mi@@ ao Yi as Cave Master , so he could only cup his f@@ ists and respond with ‘ honesty ’ . “ Cave Master has just arrived and so is probably unaware , but East Arrival City has yet to send its servants here , so our meals have to be taken care of by ourselves . To s@@ ate my hunger , your subordinate had to leave temporarily , but I couldn ’ t have imagined that something like this would happen . ”
Wang Z@@ ifa and the rest also cup@@ ped their f@@ ists and reas@@ sured Mi@@ ao Yi , “ Cave Master , we can assure you , Senior Brother Song Fu was having a meal with us just now . ”
Mi@@ ao Yi pointed to the fallen sign and said an@@ gr@@ ily , “ Then are you telling me this fell by itself ? Don ’ t tell me it was blown down by the wind ! ”
Song Fu was lost for words , and could only raise his hand and say , “ Cave Master , I can swear in the name of all the masters from past generations of the School of Blue Jade , this was definitely not our doing . If I ’ ve uttered a single lie , then let me , Song Fu , die a miserable death ! ”
Mi@@ ao Yi ’ s eyes fl@@ ashed as he swept his gaze at everyone around him , and said solem@@ nly , “ Could it be that someone is seeking trouble at my East Arrival Cave ? ”
Everyone was shocked — this truly was a possibility , and they began to survey their surroundings .
“ What are you all still waiting here for ? ”
“ Don ’ t tell me you ’ re waiting for someone to off you in your sleep ? S@@ pread out and search for clu@@ es , hurry up ! ”
Mi@@ ao Yi voiced an@@ gr@@ ily .
Yan Xi@@ u and his group were the first to cup their f@@ ists and acknowledge the order , and quickly spread out towards the surrounding mountain forests .
“ H@@ mm ? ”
Mi@@ ao Yi snor@@ ted loudly , and gla@@ red at Song Fu and his group , as though asking — since this was not your doing , why are you still not searching ? Do you know something ?
Right now they had to prove they ’ d had nothing to do with the incident . Song Fu quickly turned his head around and remarked , “ Hur@@ ry up and follow the Cave Master ’ s orders to search ! ”
They all cup@@ ped their f@@ ists at Mi@@ ao Yi , and quickly dispersed .
But Song Fu was stopped by Mi@@ ao Yi . “ Song Fu , you follow me ! ”
Song Fu was taken ab@@ ack , he cup@@ ped his f@@ ists in acknowledgement , then followed behind Mi@@ ao Yi .
Just when all of them had left , a haz@@ y sil@@ hou@@ ette , like a water@@ y reflection , appeared out of thin air . It was none other than the figure of the ever-@@ gr@@ aceful Lao Ba@@ i .
He was looking at the fallen stone memorial arch , and lightly shaking his head , he smiled . “ The affairs of the world are like a game of chess ; a ho@@ t-@@ bloo@@ ded young man should not only have the bra@@ very of a normal man ! ”
“ Br@@ at , I ’ ve always been worried that you were too kind@@ -@@ hearted , and easily taken advantage of … A boy must ram@@ page with w@@ it , a reck@@ less br@@ ute will not reach the heavens . I am now quite reas@@ sured . ”
As he said this , his figure ’ s shape oscill@@ ated like waves , and he quietly disappeared amid@@ st the oscill@@ ations , with not a trace to be seen .
The cand@@ les in the East Arrival Grand Hall d@@ anced about as Song Fu followed behind Mi@@ ao Yi and stood still within . Outside , Char@@ coal had already stood up , and as though sensing something was about to happen , it s@@ nee@@ zed loudly .
Mi@@ ao Yi expres@@ sion@@ lessly glanced at his own pri@@ zed seat , his hands behind his back as he faced Song Fu . He stood there without ut@@ tering a sound .
The atmosphere between the two was slightly tense , and Song Fu waited for a moment , before finally asking , “ What does Cave Master ask of me ? ”
Mi@@ ao Yi asked in a solemn tone , “ Song Fu , are you aware of your sins ? ”
Song Fu had a trace of mo@@ ck@@ ery on the corner his lips . Looking at the dishes on the short table to the side , he said in@@ differently , “ This incident was not my doing , what sin do I bear ? ”
“ I am not asking about this ! ”
Mi@@ ao Yi suddenly turned around and gla@@ red at him . Word by word , he asked col@@ dly , “ I ordered you to guard the mountain gates , so why did you leave your post ? Do you not regard my Cave Master ’ s orders with any importance ? ! ”
Song Fu was thinking — what do you think ?
I never held it in any regard in the first place .
Obviously , he would not say that out loud . “ Song Fu has already clarified to the Cave Master . I could not help it , and only moment@@ arily left my post to s@@ ate my hunger . I do not want to see something like this to happen as well . ”
Mi@@ ao Yi asked , “ Do you think if I were to report this to the superi@@ ors , Manor Head and Mountain Chi@@ ef@@ tain , that they would believe your explanation ? ”
Song Fu ch@@ uck@@ led . “ A human ’ s mouth has two layers , so if Cave Master insists on framing me , then please do as you wish . But Cave Master , please do not forget , I also have a mouth to dispute you , and I am not mu@@ te . ”
Mi@@ ao Yi laughed . “ It seems as though you really will not learn ! ”
As he said this , Yan Xi@@ u , Dan Bi@@ ao@@ yi and Qi@@ u Sha@@ o@@ qu@@ n , one after the other , quickly appeared outside the door . They came inside and cup@@ ped their f@@ ists towards Mi@@ ao Yi . “ Cave Master , for the moment we have not found any suspicious persons . ”
Mi@@ ao Yi replied , “ The suspicious person is right in front of you , why do you say you have not found him ! ”
Dan Bi@@ ao@@ yi and Qi@@ u Sha@@ o@@ qu@@ n , as though receiving a signal , quickly moved to close the doors to the hall .
Song Fu was shocked upon hearing this , and he quickly turned around , only to find Yan Xi@@ u already an@@ gr@@ ily sw@@ inging forth his broad axes like a re@@ aper .
Song Fu quickly pulled out the sword he always carried , a cold gle@@ am d@@ ashed out from the sc@@ ab@@ b@@ ard , a cl@@ ing-@@ cl@@ ang as he has@@ tily blocked .
Dan Bi@@ ao@@ yi and Qi@@ u Sha@@ o@@ qu@@ n also immediately thrust their spe@@ ars out , attacking Song Fu in un@@ ison .
Yan Xi@@ u and Song Fu ’ s cultivation base was pretty much equal , so the two of them were matched in the first place , but with the addition of Dan Bi@@ ao@@ yi and Qi@@ u Sha@@ o@@ qu@@ n into the f@@ ray , Song Fu ’ s circumstances immediately became precarious .
“ Sham@@ eless thief ! ”
“ To dare frame — ”
Being surrounded and unable to escape , Song Fu , who could only wave his sword to desperately come to a draw with Yan Xi@@ u , had not even finished bel@@ lowing , before two fran@@ tically thr@@ us@@ ting spe@@ ars pi@@ er@@ ced through his transc@@ end@@ ence protection , brut@@ ally sta@@ bbing his chest .
Song Fu ’ s eyes widened as he desperately turned his head to look at Mi@@ ao Yi , his lips trembling — the hatred in his eyes was in@@ descri@@ b@@ able .
He finally understood that this was a plot , the mountain memorial arch@@ way falling was not just to pin the blame on him , but also to separate him from his comr@@ ades and to prevent him from retali@@ ating together with them — the main objective was to take his life .
“ It ’ s in the eastern campus ? ”
Zhou T@@ u was obviously hes@@ itant . He had received warnings from both the school and the sen@@ iors to stay away from the eastern campus , but they did not give a specific reason . However , from their tone , he could tell that the eastern campus was a very dangerous place .
“ You guys have a deep misunderstanding about the eastern campus . It is actually not that different from here , but there are two different administrative styles to the management . The people there live in actual terror , but you guys live in a fake happiness . ”
Chen G@@ e looked into Zhou T@@ u ’ s eyes . “ Compared to you lot , they are actually closer to hope because at least they know who they are and know how to achieve salvation . ”
Chen G@@ e did not lie to Zhou T@@ u ; be it the students from eastern or western campus , they were both trapped in the school .
The students of the western campus had their memories altered and kept repeated the life created by the cul@@ pr@@ it ; the students of the eastern campus at least knew how to look for a scap@@ e@@ goat to try and find a way to escape .
“ The students from the eastern campus are closer to hope ? ”
“ But I heard only trash that are not wanted by the western campus are sent to the eastern campus . ”
Zhou T@@ u was slowly persuaded , but he still felt quite un@@ settled by the whole idea .
“ No matter the standard use , any school that treats their students as trash has to be a tr@@ ash@@ y school itself , wouldn ’ t you agree ? ”
Chen G@@ e reached out to point at the tall wall separating the two camp@@ uses . “ Do you know the purpose of this wall ? ”
“ What is it ? ”
“ It ’ s because the school is afraid of the worlds going out of control . They utilized various methods to re@@ construct societal order , but humanity is the most complicated thing in the world . ”
“ No matter how they try to alter the memory , once something happens , the scar that has been left behind will forever be se@@ ared on the heart . ”
“ Not rememb@@ ering anything doesn ’ t mean that it has not happened , so the school ’ s plan is destined to fail from the beginning . ”
Chen G@@ e kept saying things that the members failed to understand . They had no idea why Chen G@@ e would say these things , but they found themselves agreeing with him .
Those young men were naturally curious . Chen G@@ e kept telling them the truth about this school , and he finally managed to ar@@ ouse their interest .
“ So , are we going over there now ? ”
“ Hon@@ estly , I still have a hard time believing that the art room in my dream really exists within the eastern campus , ” Zhou T@@ u whispered cyn@@ ically .
“ Now is not the time . ”
Chen G@@ e turned to glance at this shadow . The shadow from Room 4@@ 13 was still alive , but its body had changed .
If one looked closer , one would realize how Chen G@@ e ’ s shadow was different from others . It was dark as ink like it was capable of sw@@ allowing the light .
It seemed to have grown stronger .
The potential of the shadow was a tr@@ ump card for Chen G@@ e . After it had wo@@ ken up , he would lead the students to the eastern campus and go after abandoned Spec@@ ters .
That way , he could not only improve his own power , he could mud@@ dy the waters at the school to provide some dis@@ traction for the other ‘ killer ’ .
Now is the time to gather strength . Before the cul@@ pr@@ it notices a small bug like myself , I need to gather as much strength as I can .
Chen G@@ e turned to look at Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng . He knew a thing or two about the other members ’ stories , but he knew the least about this lim@@ ping boy who had been the first member to join his club . “ The next location we ’ re going is Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng ’ s dormitory bedroom . ”
“ My bedroom ? ”
After hearing that , Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng gave a strange reaction . He quickly shook his hands . “ I don ’ t think that ’ s a good idea . There ’ s nothing worth seeing in my bedroom . ”
“ When you said that , your tone was higher than normal , and you also spoke faster . Other than that , your eyes were fl@@ ut@@ tering . You are really bad at lying . ”
Chen G@@ e touched Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng ’ s shoulder lightly . “ Why won ’ t you let us go there ? ”
“ What are you worried about us seeing ? ”
“ I … ”
Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng thought about it for a long time but could not come up with an excuse . Finally , he turned his head away . “ It ’ s nothing . In that case , let ’ s go now . ”
“ Sure . ”
Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng lived in Room 4@@ 13 of the western campus while Lin S@@ isi stayed at Room 4@@ 13 of the eastern campus .
The num@@ bering of the room was similar , but in Room 4@@ 13 of the western campus , other than the fourth bed , the other beds were occupied . Conversely , on the eastern campus , it was the total opposite ; only the fourth bed was occupied , and the others were empty .
“ We should keep our club ’ s secret from other people . Try to keep a low profile . There are staff like myself at the school , but there are also other staff who might not share my views . ”
Chen G@@ e was on high alert . They had created too big a com@@ motion at the lab building , so the school might have started an investigation already .
There ’ s not much time left for me . After checking Room 4@@ 13 , we should find a place to hide for a while .
There were four floors in total in the western campus ’ male dormitory . The number of students was several times higher than the number on the eastern campus . It was not yet time for lights out , and the time they arrived was the most ch@@ ao@@ tic , lively time at the dormitory . The sound of washing , plastic bas@@ ins falling , and chat@@ ting could be heard when they stood outside the building .
“ This building looks similar to the one on the eastern campus . ”
Chen G@@ e acted very normal as he entered the first building with the four students .
The door to the manager ’ s room was closed , but the window was open . A middle-@@ aged woman in her fif@@ ties was hum@@ ming a d@@ it@@ ty inside ; she seemed to be in a good mood .
There was a notice stuck next to the window . It spoke of various warnings like the using of high voltage electrical appliances and using a stove fire in the dormitory .
If I remember correctly , the notice on the board in the eastern campus ’ dormitory read , ‘ Due to the recent vicious crimes happening around campus , students are forbidden from leaving the dormitory after lights out . ’
A wall separated two different walls , just like how it was inside and outside the door .
Walking down the corridor , the group finally reached the door to Room 4@@ 13 .
“ This dormitory is no different from other dorm@@ itories . I don ’ t understand why we ’ re here . ”
Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng opened the door . Even when he walked into the room , his room@@ mates treated him like an invisible person . They kept doing their thing , and no one even acknowledged his presence .
After Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng took several steps into the room , the boy who had the bed closest to the door suddenly pulled off the cover to gl@@ are at him . “ How many times I ’ ve told you this ? ”
“ Close the door after you enter . I know you ’ ve injured your leg , but have you injured your ears as well ? ”
The boy used a very harsh tone ; it sounded like he hated Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng for some reason .
“ The reason he didn ’ t close the door is because someone else is coming in . If you want an apology , we can apologize on his behalf , but I wonder , what kind of apology do you require ? ”
Chen G@@ e grabbed the door@@ kno@@ b and entered the room . He looked at the occup@@ ants .
When the lad saw Chen G@@ e , his courage dissip@@ ated . With a grow@@ l , he pulled the cover back .
“ Mr. Ba@@ i , this is bed number four . Because it is un@@ occupied , we use it to store our luggage . ”
Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng pointed at the fourth bed . Several su@@ it@@ cases and bags of trash were left on it . In this bedroom , only Wang Y@@ ic@@ heng ’ s stuff was left beside his bed , the other people threw their stuff onto bed four .
Chen G@@ e was very familiar with bed four because he had slept on it on the eastern campus .
Walking up to the bed , he noticed that even though no one used this bed , there were bed sheets and covers . They had been made dirty by the luggage and trash that was left there .
“ Su@@ z@@ ak@@ u . ”
While inside the d@@ ain@@ ty looking bamboo cabin , Ba@@ i Yan was just in the middle of watching her son and Dr@@ ag@@ ony playing out in the front yard when she over@@ heard the com@@ motion : “ What ’ s happening outside , why is there so much noise ? ”
“ Go have a look . ”
Ar@@ ching her first , the pho@@ en@@ ix woman left as told to investigate only to return not long afterwards . H@@ es@@ itant in her voice : “ Queen , there are two people outside wanting to meet you … . ”
“ Looking for me ? ”
raising a bro@@ w , Ba@@ i Yan was rather surprised by the answer . “ I ’ ll go out and meet them then . ”
Getting up from the chair , Ba@@ i Yan cas@@ ually stro@@ lled out of the cabin to find two unexpected people qui@@ vering at her entrance .
Perhaps it ’ s the fact that they had climbed up the mountain in such an ind@@ ignant manner , but those kne@@ ec@@ aps had already been rid@@ den with blood , thus leaving a trail behind themselves as well .
“ What are you two doing ? ”
S@@ lightly fur@@ rowing her bro@@ w , Ba@@ i Yan sn@@ aps at the two men .
P@@ ale in the face , Second El@@ der un@@ comfortably answers first : “ Queen , I am here to at@@ one for my sin . That day I fool@@ ish@@ ly believed in that im@@ poster ’ s word and caused the misunderstanding between you and His Majesty , everything is my fault . I am willing to bear any form of punishment you see fit , please punish me . ”
“ No Queen , the fault is mine and not Second elder ’ s . His Majesty ordered me to bring you word of his departure in order to lift the seal , but I got ca@@ reless and m@@ ish@@ and@@ led the mission . This is all my fault , please punish me instead . ”
K@@ ne@@ eling there with tears s@@ lob@@ bering up his face , Fire Pl@@ ume held nothing back and pulled one of the bamboo sticks out from his back .
Pres@@ enting it before his queen , it ’ s obvious he wants her to wh@@ ip him with the damn thing .
But words are words . When the item finally left his hand after Ba@@ i Yan picked it up , his body inherently fro@@ ze over for the im@@ pending strike .
Yet … .
nothing came of it .
There ’ s no pain or the sound of bamboo hitting his flesh , nor are there any words of s@@ col@@ ding or cur@@ ses , just an uncomfortable silence as he hung his head low .
“ Did you suffer a lot when craw@@ ling up here ? ” It was Ba@@ i Yan who eventually broke the awkward moment with her words .
“ Q@@ u … Queen ? ”
Fire Pl@@ ume looks up in confusion , un@@ sure what to make of that .
“ In that case then your crimes have been at@@ oned . ”
Ba@@ i Yan has always been a person who holds a clear line on what ’ s right and wrong , meaning she would only target those whom wishes her harm .
What ’ s more , does she even have the right to get angry at these two when she herself was fool@@ ed into those lies ? Of course not !
Fire Pl@@ ume on the other hand was stiff as a rock right now despite the goodwill . This loyal subordinate of Di Can@@ g ’ s just couldn ’ t believe he ’ s going to be let off the hook this easily .
In fact , this bird man has prepared for the worse .
The bare minimum would be a long session of being wh@@ ipped until their skin was bleeding , or at least lose half their life in the process .
Getting anno@@ yed in the face after getting no reaction from the two : “ What ? ”
“ Do you want me to help lift you two up or something ? ”
Sure enough , the fierce voice finally knocked them both out of the d@@ az@@ ed state . Jer@@ king up in his has@@ te , Fire Pl@@ ume suddenly found himself unable to steady his legs due to the scr@@ ap@@ es he suffered so far .
Even so , he continues to force that sha@@ ky leg to remain standing in light of how awkward and funny he appears . If one had to describe his appearance , it would be like a duck squ@@ at@@ ting around after being tired out .
Unable to bear this ridiculous picture , Ba@@ i Yan rolls her eyes and points to the stone sto@@ ols nearby : “ S@@ it over there and rest . Once the both of you are better then go back . ”
