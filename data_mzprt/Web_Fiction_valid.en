Lin Du frowned. “whether she’s breathing or not, we shouldn’t care. We don’t need to get involved. ”
The driver also knew that if his boss didn’t say anything, he wouldn’t be able to save this girl.
Lin Du said, “ignore her. Move Her aside and focus on driving. ”
Sh didn’t say anything. She just quietly looked at the document in her hand. Her ghost-like eyes made people not dare to ask any more questions.
The driver had no choice but to force himself to push her away. As he pushed her away, he kept muttering, “Miss, if you accidentally die, don’t look for me. Look for the fierce person in the car. He didn’t let me save you. ”
Lu Yuxi was very thin and small, so with just a gentle push, she could be pushed to the side.
The driver swallowed his saliva. “Miss, I’m sorry. ”
With that, he ran back to the car as if he was running away. He turned the key and started the car.
However, who would have thought that when the car slowly drove away, SH’s casual glance would change his life for the rest of his life.
Sh looked out of the window and lay on the ground. The woman whose face was facing up made his heart tremble.
It was her. How could it be her? How could she be lying here in such a miserable state.
“Stop the car, ” Sh shouted.
Lin Du, who was sitting in front, turned around in confusion. “Sh, WHAT’S WRONG? ”
“Did you hear what I said? Stop the car, ” Sh roared and asked the driver to stop the car.
After stopping the car, SH politely ran out of the car and rushed to Lu Yuxi, who was by the roadside. He hugged her and directly carried her into the car.
Lin Du could not understand why SH would do this. “little master, what are you doing? ”
“stop talking nonsense. Drive quickly. Go back quickly and let Lo take a look. ”
Lin Du was only his subordinate. He could not disobey orders, so he could only nod.
The driver looked up in disbelief. He was only joking just now, saying that the young master would help him save this girl. He did not expect it to be true.
“What are you waiting for? Drive. ” 
Lin Du was blocked by SH, so he had nowhere to vent his anger. The driver had just become his punching bag.
Looking at the blood that was dripping from his forehead and face, SH frowned.
How could this be? She was still so obedient and cute the other day. Why would she appear here today? If he had not passed by, would she have died here.
The elegant style, gentle lighting, and european-style furniture undoubtedly spoke of the owner’s taste.
“How is she? ” 
Sh asked worriedly.
Lo curled the corners of his mouth and laughed hysterically. “When did our young master hide such a beautiful woman? Look at her small face and figure. She’s definitely a beauty. ”
Sh blinked. “stop talking nonsense. If You keep talking, you won’t be able to see your daughter. ”
Sh seemed to have reached his point of fear. He suddenly became serious. “The wound has been bandaged. She must have suffered a serious impact to fall into a coma. Also, it seems that the anesthetic was found in her body. ”
As he spoke, he took out the film in his hand. “The anesthetic may not affect her, but her body and brain have suffered a serious impact. Perhaps, she will lose her Hermes. ”
Sh clenched his fists and looked like he was going to hit someone. “speak in human language and use your non-medical thinking to talk to me. You know the consequences. ”
Lo: “young master, don’t be so angry. What I mean is, if it’s serious, it’s very likely that she will lose her memory, and it’s all of her memories. ”
His tone was powerful and firm!
The aura was extremely fierce and intense!
A light shone across the land!
The person who came was Gabriel. He told Long Mixu, Michael, and Wu Xian’er to continue building the Teleportation Formation while he rushed over.
The Celestial Artifact’s aura was really obvious and he was able to sense it from a few hundred miles away.
That was why he came!
A sword energy slashed down from the heavens!
It parted the sky and halted the Great Xia Dragonfinch’s attack!
Hong!
This strike was extremely powerful like two planets colliding. Even Heaven Heart was impacted by it and he flew backward. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and the phenomenons around him all scattered.
The invincible Heaven Heart was injured due to the clash of the two Celestial Artifacts.
From this, one could see how terrifyingly strong a Celestial Artifact was.
Both the Great Xia Dragonfinch and Gabriel’s celestial sword flew backward, and he grabbed it.
“Who are you?” 
Xia Wuxu asked with a dark expression.
The Dragonfinch in his hand was trembling. It was roaring in rage…
Since the beginning, the Great Xia Dragonfinch had been invincible. It killed numerous people and had never met someone who was its match.
But now, the Great Xia Dragonfinch had met a strong enemy. A Celestial Artifact that was not weaker than it. Both of them were on par after that single clash.
The six pairs of wings behind Gabriel’s back slowly appeared. He was wrapped in angel war armor and wore a helmet that only showed his eyes. He said coldly, “Archangel Gabriel!”
Xia Wuxu frowned. This name was so weird and it was the first time he had heard it.
The Crown Prince said emotionally, “He is the one. He is on the same side as this bald monk and he was the one who snatched the World Coordinates from me. They are definitely building the World Grade Teleportation Formation behind there. The most valuable use of the World Coordinates is to build the formation!”
Xia Wuxu’s gaze turned cold. They were building the World Grade Teleportation Formation to find more experts?
“You are asking to die.” 
Gabriel looked at the Crown Prince and scoffed coldly. The celestial sword in his hand was like jade; it was white and transparent. He slashed forwards lightly.
Explosion!
Sword energy shot out a few hundred feet and slashed towards the Crown Prince.
Gabriel wanted to kill the noisy Crown Prince.
“You dare to kill someone when you are in front of me?” 
Xia Wuxu was furious. He waved the Great Xia Dragonfinch to shatter the sword energy.
Explosion!
The sword energy and blade energy clashed, sweeping the black soil around. The shockwaves looked really terrifying and intense.
The Crown Prince was so terrified that he fell down to the ground. That sword really caused him to feel what death was like.
If Xia Wuxu hadn’t saved him, he would have definitely died.
That was because he didn’t have Heaven Heart’s ability to block a strike from a Celestial Artifact!
“Thank you, Xia Wuxu!” 
The Crown Prince wiped off the cold sweat and he was filled with gratitude.
“Bring your men forwards and destroy the Teleportation Formation. I will fight against this person.” 
Xia Wuxu said coldly.
After learning that Heaven Heart was building a World Grade Teleportation Formation, Xia Wuxu instantly thought back to what happened to Founder Demon Sect.
Founder Demon Sect did have the materials to craft the World Grade Teleportation Formation.
He knew that he definitely couldn’t allow them to build the World Grade Teleportation Formation. Otherwise, once their helpers arrived, all their efforts would go to waste.
This was why he saved the Crown Prince. If he hadn’t, he would be too lazy to interact with such a person.
That’s right, the Crown Prince was just a piece of trash to him!
The Crown Prince didn’t know, instead, he felt really grateful toward Xia Wuxu; he felt like he was a real expert who had the ability to see the big picture. He knew who was useful and saved him so that he could help thwart Long Mixu’s evil plans.
“Long Mixu, Heaven Heart, I don’t care what plans you have. I will destroy the World Grade Teleportation Formation and your plan will just collapse.” 
The Crown Prince laughed coldly.
“Go. All of you follow me to destroy the World Grade Teleportation Formation. Whoever puts in the most effort will be greatly rewarded.” 
The Crown Prince said in rage as he dashed forward.
The 10 Dao Saints who followed him all went full speed ahead as they all saw hope. Naturally, they were all really motivated.
Gabriel raised his Celestial Artifact and wanted to kill them.
Hong!
But a blade light slashed across which forced him to retreat. He looked at the person with a frown.
Xia Wuxu held the Great Xia Dragonfinch and was in mid-air staring at Gabriel.
“I am your opponent. The Great Xia Dragonfinch is your opponent!” 
Xia Wuxu said calmly.
Gabriel frowned. This person was really asking to die.
“You fight him here. I will go to protect the Teleportation Formation.” 
Heaven Heart climbed up, suppressing the pain from his injuries, and rushed back.
“A monk who isn’t at his peak won’t be able to fight the other 10 Dao Saints even if he returns.” 
Xia Wuxu said with disdain, not worried at all.
When the two Celestial Artifacts clashed, Heaven Heart was badly injured as he faced them head-on.
It wasn’t the strength of one Celestial Artifact!
But, two!
It was amazing that he wasn’t heavily injured and had even managed to survive!
At the moment, Heaven Heart didn’t have the same combat strength as before.
Gabriel squinted his eyes and stabbed the Celestial Sword in his hand forwards. “Die!”
Long Mixu, Michael, Wu Xian’er were nervously building the World Grade Teleportation Formation! They carefully followed the instructions in the blueprints, one by one.
In just a short time, the rough outline could be seen and the foundation layer had already been built.
They were now adding new things to build it up.
This was a really detailed and precise job which was perfect for Long Mixu and Wu Xian’er.
Especially Long Mixu who was on her final step before she managed to reach her dreams.
As long as this Teleportation Formation was built and Li Xiandao could cross over, her dream would be fulfilled.
Long Mixu was more serious and focused than anyone else.
Michael was in charge of moving the large-sized treasures and materials. Even if they had the blueprints, it was still problematic and tough to build a large World Grade Teleportation Formation.
In the hands of these three, the process was really orderly and efficient. They progressed really swiftly.
Lucifer held the six demon blades and tried to merge them one by one.
The seventh blade was still on the way.
Lucifer wasn’t far away. He was the barrier behind Heaven Heart and had nothing to do, so he tried to merge the World Breaking Blade.
Just as Lucifer was studying it, a thunder-like sound spread out from the distance.
The Crown Prince brought 10 Dao Saints to charge over.
They surrounded Lucifer and all of them stared at him.
“You are Heaven Heart’s partner?” 
The Crown Prince asked coldly.
“What if I am? What if I’m not?” 
Lucifer asked calmly.
“If you aren’t, then move aside. Don’t let me harm an innocent person.” 
The Crown Prince said coldly.
“If you are partners, then die!” 
A sharp glow flashed in the Crown Prince’s eyes.
“You all won’t be able to kill me,” Lucifer kept the six demon blades and said.
“If the 10 of them can’t, then what about the few of us?” 
A furious voice rang out.
“What about us? We also came to kill you.” 
Another person said furiously.
Lucifer frowned.Aren’t You Embarrassed
Yang Chen snorted at her remark. “Yes yes. I know I’m more prone than most. Every time I see a beauty my eyes shine.”
“I met Jane about eight to nine years ago, back when she was just a kid. One could say I watched her grow up through the years the way older siblings do. So naturally, like all other older siblings, I would wish for her to find the right person when he comes by. So why would I swoop in and take her for myself?”
“Moving on, it’s time for you to get up now. I have to take you to examine the cauldron, then over to our house for a decent meal, My mum and the others couldn’t wait to express their gratitude for you saving my life.”
“Chill a little, I need to bid a proper farewell with the nurses. Do you know Ms Jane’s student, Grace? She took good care of me throughout my time here. Why don’t you just sit and wait a while,” Xue Zhiqing replied.
Yang Chen ruffled through his hair. “Honestly, couldn’t you have done all this before I came?”
“Sheesh, why are you so frantic all the time? I didn’t see you being all naggy and grumpy when Jane was around. I’m still a patient you know.”
Yang Chen chuckled. “I wouldn’t dare. But isn’t it pretty obvious that it’s a problem with your scheduling?”
“Oh so it’s okay for you to be spurting nonsense but I can’t stay a little longer? Men are pathetic.” Xue Zhiqing grumbled as she got dressed in the clothes sent over by Jane. Women were indeed more detailed and meticulous when it comes to the little details.
Yang Chen awkwardly chuckled out loud. “Hehe, obviously I’m less formal when speaking to my loved ones. Jane is a friend. And it’s not like I was actually nagging you. C’mon Baby Qing, don’t get mad…”
Xue Zhiqing’s cheeks instantly went red as a tomato as she glared at Yang Chen. “Eww…Baby Qing? Aren’t you embarrassed…?”
Her emotions slowly took over as Xue Zhiqing quickly turned away from Yang Chen. Her heart was fluttering like butterflies in her belly when he mentioned ‘loved ones’. While she found it affectionate, it gave her much anticipation of what lies ahead.
Throughout her rough and unforgiving life, never would she ever expect that one day she would feel such warmth within her.
Under Yang Chen’s constant nagging, Xue Zhiqing bid her farewells with Grace and the other nurses in a relatively little time, and subsequently on her way alongside Yang Chen towards the forgotten nation located deep in the Mediterranean.
As they landed onto a region where the sunshine rallied deep into autumn, Xue Zhiqing quickly found herself mesmerized by the sparkling blue waters, but was instantly dragged into a massive castle by the cliff.
Along the way, Yang Chen intentionally slowed down, taking the time to explain his background and upbringing, as a form of recognition towards her.
Xue Zhiqing nonetheless was hardly astounded by his narration. After all, she herself was a member of the great ancient clans. She, however, was rather dumbfounded by the scale of Yang Chen’s harem.
But the thought that she was one among them ultimately led to her acknowledgment.
On the path leading towards the basement, made in its entirety from carving out the mountain from within, huge slabs of rock boulders impeccably ran adjacent to each other creating a cool and dry environment.
The entire space was the size of half a football field. Excluding the exquisite sculptures placed by the corners of the space, there was a majestic bronze cauldron positioned right in the center.
“You were talking about this cauldron?” 
Xue Zhiqing noticed the huge commodity nearly the height of a regular person and was perplexed.
Yang Chen, however, was enthusiastic. “What do you think? The qi resonating from the cauldron can be felt remarkably easily. My guess is that this treasured piece would be at least a mid-tier item, possibly more!”
Xue Zhiqing shook her head dismissively. “This cauldron was nowhere to be seen in the ancient scriptures. Also, this cauldron’s carvings are peculiar, to say the least. It resembled the ancient Taotie, but the Taotie had a goat’s body and these sculptures don’t quite resemble that of a goat. But if it’s not a Taotie, then I have no idea what it is.”
“Huh, doesn’t matter what the carvings are, give it a touch, is this the divine rare metal that you’ve mentioned?”
Xue Zhiqing nodded. Thereafter she brought herself closer, below her mouth promptly cracked open from amazement. “That’s…ethereal hyacinth gold?”
Even though the entire cauldron was unmistakably covered in rusty green, the woman still managed to notice the bits that were untarnished.
Yang Chen frowned. “Hyacinth gold? How’s that rare? If I remember correctly, Russia exports it on a regular basis. I mean sure it’s expensive, but hardly any special.”
“That’s where your understanding ends. It’s called the ethereal hyacinth gold for a reason. Legend has it that when carnivorous beasts from the great ancient periods die, their corpses and bones transmute into these rare metals after tens of thousands of years. It’s only been a myth for the longest time.
But one thing is for sure. These can be considered among the rarest and most precious metals there is on this planet right now. I have only once stumbled upon a ranked plate made from hyacinth gold once in my entire life. That’s how rare it is. Now you have an entire cauldron made of ethereal hyacinth gold right before us. If Hongmeng members of the mythical realm, or the Great Ancient clans find out about this, they would literally go mad.”
Yang Chen burst into laughter.“So from what you’re saying, pill refining with this cauldron would be a breeze, right?”
“Of course. But I never heard any mention of a cauldron made from ethereal hyacinth gold, but this metal is resistant to Samadhi True Fire.”
Her reply sparked curiosity in his head as he added, “If this metal could withstand the heat of the Samadhi True Fire, then how was it forged in the first place?”
Xue Zhiqing shook her head. “First off, I have never seen anyone forge this. I think that this metal might not actually be completely resistant to heat, but selective in the way it could be forged. Metals like these would not instantly melt at the touch of fire. But through divine awareness, its molecules get broken down, and gradually change its shape.
Rare metals like these require extensive refining and disintegration before forgery can take place. Anyways, are you thinking of destroying this cauldron, otherwise why’d you care?”
Yang Chen eventually cut to the chase as he enthusiastically gathered the divine herbs and placed them by the cauldron rubbing his hands in glee he requested. “Since you’re here, do you mind arranging the useful remedies accordingly? We’ll leave after the herbs are sorted out and then I’ll come back tomorrow to attempt to wrap my head around the pill refining techniques.”
Xue Zhiqing was slightly nervous as she mumbled, “Are we really eating over at your place today?”
“Are you not interested?” 
Yang Chen replied, slightly dejected.
Xue Zhiqing bit on her lower lip. “I was wondering if we could postpone it for a few days. I’m not ready to meet them yet.”
Yang Chen was quick to realize that Xue Zhiqing was still rather new towards genuine relationships and a change in identity. “Never expected you to be a shy person. We can sort it out. All I need to do is have a little talk with everyone at home. I’ll tell them that you’ll stop two days from now. Regardless, just know my mom misses you a lot and you can’t run away from this.”
Xue Zhiqing let out a sigh of relief. “Well then I’ll deal with the allocation of ingredients, there are more than enough herbs here to make more than two dozen rounds.”
Since the Xue clan was renowned for its pill refining techniques, Xue Zhiqing naturally was well accustomed to low to mid-range pills. As for high levels up to divine tier remedies, according to Xue Zhiqing, without the specific elusive ingredients, the pills can never be made.
After approximately an hour, Yang Chen dialed home. Xue Zhiqing by then already had two dozen herbs arranged accordingly to Spiritual pills, Red dewdrop pills alongside the Bodhi pills in Yang Chen’s possession, as well as mid-level pills such as the Dragon cloud and Eight extremities pills respectively.
Staying true to Xue Zhiqing’s methodology, it is most resource-effective to start with the refinery of the Spiritual pill, which provides them both with an opportunity to practice without consuming too much of their resources.
“The spiritual pill, also known as the ‘Energy retention pill’, whose role was to assist Xiantian cultivators with solidifying and utilizing the surrounding qi, while the Red dewdrop pill increases the viscosity of the divine energy.”
“The mid-tier Dragon cloud pill was far superior as it gathers divine energy while simultaneously heightening the flow of true yuan from within the veins of the cultivators, supplementing Transformed God’s cultivators with decent assistance.”
“As for the ‘Eight extremities pill’, it was by no means used for cultivation. Instead, it expanded all pulses and veins within the body, instantly hyper-charging the cultivator’s true yuan energy and massively increasing their ability during battle. Naturally, if the user’s cultivation is not up to par, there wasn’t enough true yuan to be channeled which meant they would die!”
After a point to point explanation by Xue Zhiqing, Yang Chen finally understood that divine pills could be utilized for more than just cultivation which left him with anticipation for what he could create along the way.
Unfortunately, the refined pills were only useful for the cultivations of his women. They did not help him at all
Since he was not in a hurry to return to Zhonghai, Yang Chen kept Xue Zhiqing close by his side for his first attempt in pill refining. He needed her to assist him in order to perfect the technique.
"Ha!"
The person sat up, heaving a long sigh. 
His feet lightly touched the ground as he slid down from the surgical bed.
The clothing he wore shattered with his motion. He was naked when he stood up.
The coldness on the floor reminded Qing Shui that he might be still alive. The person who was reflected in the mirror seemed unchanged. He still had brown eyes, and his muscles hadn’t increased at all. 
His Cocktail Modifiers didn't transform him into a monster looking being. He was identical to what he used to look like, except for the fact that his hair grown white. He seemed drained.
He didn't seem different from an ordinary human, but if someone was standing next to him now, they'd notice a foreign sensation about him.
His cells went through numerous divisions and revivals which drained all his energy. Perhaps the foreign sensation was that he gave an impression of someone to be revered. Besides that, his presence would leave any being in awe. He didn't feel like a human being anymore.
As if he was a hoary god, he was much more potent than humans in essence. 
But he was also past his prime, and dying as well.
Qing Shui took his time to pace in front of the mirror. He bent to picked a suit and slowly put on the garments, everything from top to bottom, ending with a sophisticated tie. Now he was well-dressed,
Something neat but not too standing out.
Qing Shui felt that he had returned to his beloved school as a teacher. 
He was calm and knowledgeable. 
He combed through his gray hair, once and twice, then placed the comb back to its tray. 
He opened the drawer beside the cabinet, from where he took out a Walkman player.
It was a model from ten years ago and seemed like a device that he had used when he was still a student. A girl was laughing in the photo sticker that was stuck to the top lid of the Walkman, though time had taken the colors from her happiness.
A sentence was also engraved on the Walkman - To my love, Qing Shui, I wish you are always happy. 
Your sweetest, Dou.
His fingers fondled the engraving, and he smiled. He inserted two batteries in the device and put earplugs in his ears. Chopin's nocturne flew into him. It was peaceful and tranquil, but filled with sorrow.
He clipped the Walkman to his belt, then continued to fumble in the drawer until he located two photographs. One was of him and an aged man and woman, and it was very worn out. 
The other was relatively new, with him, Chang, and Jing. All of them were wearing different expression in it.
Chang's smile was rigid, but anyone could tell that he had tried hard for it.
Qing Shui had a straight face; he seemed pensive.
While Jing had turned her face away from Qing Shui, so she didn't need to see him at all.
Qing Shui stared at the pictures for more than a minute, then he started chuckling. He stacked them together, made sure the edges were aligned before he tucked them into his pocket. He left the operation room to his lab, where he picked a bottle of wine from the crate under the lab desk that he had prepared for himself.
Violating the rule of drinking wine, he poured a full glass for himself, and he didn't seem to care. He almost gulped the wine, then poured another glass with the appropriate amount. He swirled the liquid, allowing enough time for oxidation. This time, he tasted with the music in his ears. Later, he walked out of the lab and took the elevator to the rooftop, where he sat down, gazing to the south.
"They all ran away." 
He seemed to be able to see as far as to the edge of Zhengzhou.
The ground started shaking, and a tremendous amount of beasts fled from the sound, roaring out of fear.
This marvelous spectacle shook the city.
Billions of insects, beasts dashed for their lives to the north. The color of the ground turned black, and the coverage of animals was even bigger than the city. The running of an uncountable amount of legs shook the architecture in the city, and rubble and dust kept falling off from the buildings as if they were shedding. Something, something had flustered the animals.
Those who dashed at the very front were the quickest and strongest. Some were worms that were more than ten meters long; some were bulls; some just looked strange in shape. They rushed into Zhengzhou like bulldozers, making their own paths out when there were none, flattening the city under a cloud of dust that roared towards the sky. The buildings collapsed like domino blocks.
Those who came after the first wave were a little more clumsy compared to their pioneers but with more variety, such as spiders and monkats. They were no longer fierce and cruel. More accurately, they took off their layers of defense and invested more energy in the grand exile.
Some wounded ones slowed down and were left behind, but exile was never merciful to the weak, and they were immediately stomped into a pile of flesh and blood.
Qing Shui stood still on the rooftop, witnessing all that happened. He seemed to care for the those lives, but at the same time, he seemed not to care either. He moved his attention to the very south, as if something over there could genuinely intrigue him.
Even though the herd crashed over most of Zhengzhou, they somehow avoided the institute. 
As if they sensed its danger by instinct, some of the slow ones would rather get stomped than step in the forbidden zone.
This applied to all who came, they veered right before they would enter the zone.
The herds were just nobodies sandwiched between two gods.
Therefore, nothing was Qing Shui's business except for the minor disturbance from the ground shaking. He was still tasting his wine in tranquility.
The wave lasted for longer than the flying animals’ migration.
The herds fled for a day and a night, and the wave didn't seem to decrease its density until the second day's afternoon. Qing Shui had his half-emptied bottle of wine in hand and was still waiting.
The insects came the last, forming black waves on the ground. They were left last from the disadvantage of having smaller body sizes.
Finally, the ground shook more intensely than ever; something caused a drumming and rumbling to run through the city!
The deafening resonance came from afar, getting amplified in time. Eventually, the sound wave was so intense that it triggered an invisible tsunami.
The clouds of the insects arched over the ground, and skyscrapers were no longer able to stand tall. Their collapses resulted with the death of insects.
"Hey, Willow, here you are." 
The bottle of wine shattered, and the blood-colored wine splashed all over the floor.
The vibration was radical and violent, but Qing Shui stood still, like he always did, while the world fell apart in front of him.
The Willow had arrived.
In the jungle south of Zhengzhou, wickers dived in and out of the soil upon their fall from the sky. They were so many of them! Each one of them was almost one hundred meters in diameter. These astute wickers wriggled through, regardless of what organisms got in their way. They powdered them and absorbed them, turning them into tiny particles of this dome.
Perhaps the idea of one hundred meters was vague when one did compare them to anything. But one hundred meters could be the altitude of a mountain’s peak.
The only thing known was the diameter of these wickers while their lengths were hidden in the dark. The number of them seemed uncountable as their motion blotted out the sky and covered the earth. They plunged in, creating caverns, and burst out toward the firmament. They moved like pythons or anacondas, but they were much more flexible.
Their greed was endless. They would gnaw and destroy everything in their way, and even split out smaller wickers to penetrate the earth, sucking out nutrients from the soil. They also raised their head to the sky and tore through the clouds to bathe in the radiance of the Sun so that the invasion would always be energetic.
There was nothing, nothing on this planet that had the same figure as the Willow. And there was nothing that could be as destructive as the Willow.
The wickers drowned souls and lives but flourished themselves. Every place they passed was left green. That green was so thick and rich that it almost gave out an illusion that the Willow spared lives under its cruelty. But the vibrant color came from homogeneity, for it strangled the diversity and arrogantly claimed its trophies from others’ homeland.
This could have been a tribute of lives. The whole invasion was as smooth as if God had dropped down his hand from the heaven, with his fingers being the wickers, and he was going to grab the Earth in his palm.
"It’s been a long time, Willow!"
The vibration amplified, and his fingertips finally reached Zhengzhou.
Then, the hand opened up its palm. The blood was green leaves that were proliferating on the land. Nothing was left in its wake, the evidence of humanity's existence wiped out effortlessly. One of the wickers dived from the sky toward Qing Shui. It blocked out the Sun and aimed at Qing Shui' eyes while he was looking up.
"Hello, it's been a while. You arrived just in t—"
Qing Shui seemed to have lost control of his body and his wineglass dropped.
"Marvelous..."
Qing Shui's word marked the last exclamation of humanity in this city. 
He was the last voice of humankind here, and his word echoed, representing millions of humans who had existed here.
"Qing Shui Li is dead." 
The clones' word froze Chang. They all spoke at the same time, breaking the silence, as well as turning to the south.
The eyes of the girl in blue turned watery and seemed extremely sympathetic.
Those watching felt bad for her and told Zhao Feng to sell the little thieving cat to the girl.
“Sure, a billion primal crystal stones.”
Zhao Feng laughed.
The youth in black clenched his fists tightly and stared angrily at Zhao Feng. If it wasn’t because they were on the Crossing Sky Ship he might have already attacked.
Zhao Feng’s one billion primal crystal stones price obviously didn’t have any intention of trading. He was just playing with them.
“Ting’er, wait till we cross the River of Rage and enter the Canopy Great Country. I’ll buy the exact same cat.”
The plainly dressed elderly person behind the two laughed.
The little thieving cat revealed expressions of disdain as it extended a finger pointing towards the sky. Following this, it then extended two fingers and compared it.
“It’s saying it’s the only one? There won’t be another?”
The people nearby could obviously understand its meaning.
Only one in the world. Never another the same.
Miao miao!
The little thieving cat nodded its head proudly in response to the crowd.
Everyone’s jaws were wide open and were extremely surprised. The intelligence of this cat could be compared to the Fox beasts.
“Uncle Liu, look! It’s saying that it’s the only one in the world. How can you buy the same one for me?”
The girl in blue pouted and gazed unwillingly towards the little thieving cat, not wanting to leave.
The plainly dressed elder was helpless and the youth in black stared at Zhao Feng with hatred.
Zhao Feng was speechless. In this short amount of time he had offended two groups of people.
The former group wanted to buy his Azure Sharp Swallow but enmity appeared after they were rejected.
This group wanted to buy his little thieving cat but wanted to take it because they couldn’t afford it.
Sigh, what kind of world is this?
Zhao Feng couldn’t help but shake his head. Thinking about it carefully, the reason was because they thought he was easy to bully.
He was alone, had low cultivation, and came from outside the Canopy Great Country. Everyone thought of him as a countryman, and easy target.
The Crossing Sky Ship slowly moved forwards.
Zhao Feng could feel Qi Jiu and Grey Cat Eagle’s coldness.
In the other group, the youth in black was full of anger as he felt that he had humiliated by Zhao Feng.
The plainly dressed elder at the half-step True Spirit Realm’s eyes twinkled, it was impossible to see his thoughts.
“If these two groups attack together after I get off the ship…..”
Zhao Feng hiccupped coldly.
Just the silver haired youth Qi Jiu alone was comparable to Cang Yuyue.
The strongest person should be the plainly dressed elder who had already formed the Qi of half-step True Spirit. He would even be able to resist against normal cultivators at True Human Rank.
Zhao Feng thought that even if he wasn’t his match, he could run away with his Yin Shadow Cloak and Lightning Inheritance.
“Little friend, the Overlooking Mist Liu family’s name is very good and we don’t force trades, but we can’t be sure others won’t.” 
“If you don’t mind, you can come with us three for the time being.”
The plainly dressed elder suggested.
Zhao Feng’s heart jumped. The older one was indeed smart.
He could tell that the current situation wasn’t very good for Zhao Feng and if he helped Zhao Feng solve it, Zhao Feng would owe him a debt.
At the same time Zhao Feng had to loosen up on selling the cat.
Zhao Feng went into deep thought.
He wasn’t scared of these two groups. Even if he wasn’t their match he could retreat safely.
But… the Overlooking Mist Liu family was a good trace.
Zhao Feng didn’t know the place well nor know anyone. 
He wasn’t even sure which Liu family he was to find.
“How about you three have to ensure my safety after we get off the boat. As for the exchange, if the little thieving cat wants to go with you, I won’t stop it.”
Zhao Feng answered.
“Sure.”
The plainly dressed elder revealed a happy expression. 
Behind their backs was an enormous family with rich resources. With the little thieving cat’s intelligence, it would definitely come to them with the resources provided.
After the plainly dressed elder and Zhao Feng came to a deal, the former told the girl in blue and youth in black.
“Great! Uncle Liu instantly succeeds.”
The girl in blue said happily, as if the little thieving cat was already in her hands.
The youth in black harrumphed coldly but the enmity on his face didn’t decrease.
With the little thieving cat as the connection line, Zhao Feng soon knew the three people.
The plainly dressed elder who was called “Uncle Liu” was an Elder of the Overlooking Mist Liu family.
The girl in blue was called Liu Tingyu and was a genius of the younger generation but from the spoiledness Uncle Liu gave her, one could tell that her identity wasn’t as simple as it looked.
The youth in black was called Liu Dong, a lover of Liu Tingyu’s.
Zhao Feng smiled and understood the background of the three.
The Overlooking Mist Province Liu family was a tiny family in the Canopy Great Country, just like how the Zhao family was in the Cloud Country.
But even such a small family had Elder’s at half-step True Spirit Realm.
From this, one could see that the advancement of cultivation in the Canopy Great Country had far exceeded the Thirteen Countries.
Zhao Feng was a person who came into the city from the farm, so him being a countryman was justified.
“Hehe.”
Liu Tingyu took out her snacks and fed it to the little thieving cat.
The little thieving cat had a huge appetite and didn’t eat normal food. Only till Liu Tingyu took out primal crystal stones and some precious spiritual pills did the little thieving cat eat happily.
The plainly dressed elder laughed. With the little thieving cats gluttony and greed for money, it wasn’t hard to trick it away from Zhao Feng.
At this moment, Zhao Feng obviously wouldn’t forget to ask Liu Tingyu and company about the situation within the Liu family.
“May I ask whether there’s a person called Qinxin in the Liu family?”
Zhao Feng asked.
His trip to the Canopy Great Country was to find this person.
This mission contributed whether the situation within the Thirteen Countries could be changed or not.
“Liu Qinxin?” 
“In just the Liu family of the Overlooking Mist Province alone there’s more than one person called Liu Qinxin.”
Uncle Liu shook his head.
There were just too many people with the same name in this vast land.
Zhao Feng stopped talking.
Back in the Zhao family, there was more than one person with the same person as him.
“In the Canopy Great Country, the Liu family of the four great families is our main families.” 
“Apart from them there’s Side families and Branch families.” 
“From what I know there’s seven Side families and several hundred Branch families….”
Uncle Liu explained.
Zhao Feng couldn’t help but click his tongue.
The Liu family was the Main family and had seven Side families under them.
Under Side families were Branch families.
The Overlooking Mist Province Liu family was just a member of the Branch families.
After knowing this Zhao Feng’s heart shook. It was hard to imagine how powerful the Liu family was. 
The Overlooking Mist Province Liu family probably didn’t even have the right to contact the main Liu family.

“Am I supposed to find the main family, side family or branch family?”
Zhao Feng’s head hurt.
The second mission was for him to send a letter. He had thought it would be simpe but the reality was extremely complex.
From the current situation the chance of being the main Liu family wasn’t high, but not impossible.
“I hope that it’s someone from the Side family who has some power. If she’s from the Branch family then that’d be troublesome….”
Zhao Feng’s eyebrows furrowed.
There was only seven side families of the Liu family and each of them were powerful forces.
But there was just too many Branch families. They were counted by the hundreds.
Zhao Feng didn’t know that when he mentioned the name Liu Qinxin to Uncle Liu, the golden robed person’s eyes flashed.
“Liu Qinxin?” 
“Could it be that person….? Impossible! No way. It must be someone who has the same name.”
The golden robed person took a deep breath and shook his head.
There were way too many people with the same name. The golden robed person thought.
The Crossing Sky Ship moved forwards.
Time quickly passed by. 
In the blink of an eye seven to eight days had gone past and the Crossing sky ship had finally approached the shore.
The shore on the opposite side of the River of Rage was crystal blue. It looked like a scenery from out of an artwork.
Zhao Feng was immersed by what he saw.
“So entrancing, so is this the holy cultivation lands of the Canopy Great Country?”
Liu Tingyu’s eyes flashed brightly and her fists were clenched, amazed by this piece of land.
The south of the River of Rage was considered desolate and barren. Only by passing the river did one truly enter the Canopy Great Country.
Zhao Feng’s God’s Spiritual Eye caught an immeasurable power in the River of Rage. It seemed to be able to rip the continent apart.
“The Heaven Earth Yuan Qi in the opposite shore is more than ten times denser than the Thirteen Countries. This River of Rage contains some power that can disrupt the distribution of Heaven Earth Yuan Qi in the Northern Continent.”
Zhao Feng took a deep breath, unable to measure that power.
“The River of Rage is a very mysterious river. The top ranked Inheritances “Heavens Legacy Inheritance” showed up here several tens of thousands of years ago and gave birth to the River of Rage…..”
Uncle Liu said as if telling a story.
“Heavens Legacy Inheritance?” 
“An Inheritance even better than the Scarlet Moon Inheritance?”
Liu Tingyu was full of curiosity.
The Scarlet Moon Inheritance was ranked 3rd of the 4 Great Inheritances and was the reason why the Scarlet Moon Patriarch reached such a height.
“The Heavens Legacy Inheritance is the most ancient and mysterious inheritance of the four. It’s appearance rate is extremely low and not much information is known about it.”
Uncle Liu smiled faintly.
There was just not enough information about the Heavens Legacy Inheritance. No one knew whether it was the strongest or not, but it was definitely the oldest and most mysterious.
“Apparently, every time the Heavens Legacy Inheritance appears, the continent’s situation would change.” 
“But this Inheritance hasn’t appeared for a long time.”
The golden robed noble who was silent suddenly said.
These were just rumours. No one would take it as true.
The Crossing Sky Ship soon reached the shore.
Sou– Sou– Sou–
Everyone left the Crossing sky ship. The fastest person was obviously the golden robed person. In a flash, he had disappeared into the clouds.
“Azure haired brat. Are you sure you’re not going to sell the Azure Sharp Swallow?”
The grey middle aged Grey Cat Eagle closed in on Zhao Feng with two helpers behind him.
On the other side the silver haired Qi Jiu had a cold mocking smile on his lips.Chapter 257: Balance
The night was not peaceful. Angor could not sleep well because he was always troubled by noises of someone yelling or things being smashed.
Angor climbed up from his bed with sleepy eyes the next morning.
He planned to sleep a bit more, but he was prevented by someone screaming madly next door—the Phantom Servant child.
Toby was chirping loudly on his bedstand. Anyone else here would find the bird terribly bothersome, although Angor knew that Toby was only singing the City of Sky in a really bad way, due to the lack of musical senses.
Angor helped Toby changed into a fisherman suit and smoothened his feathers. “There are a lot of wizards attending the fair, so don’t go wander off this time. Stay inside Prome’s yard, alright?”
Toby nodded.
Angor spent some time getting washed, then went to Dave’s room. He could still sense the illusion he deployed yesterday, and the Phantom Servant child was still yelling.
“Good morning, Angor.” 
Dave showed up, also yawning badly.
“Morning,” Angor replied in a somewhat fatigued way, despite his best effort to psych up in the bathroom.
Dave tilted his head to the kid’s room. “It took me half an hour to figure out how to get out.” 
“And only because you already told me about tricking my directions. I had to close my eyes and imagine the room to find out the door located on the ceiling inside the illusion.”
“Or you can just punch a hole on the wall to get out. My illusion’s pretty small. We can patch up the wall for Master Prome later.”
“… Right!” 
“How could I not know it? And I burned my brain cells just to redraw the room in my mind…”
Angor pointed toward the room from which the scream of the child was still coming out. “So did you learn anything from him?”
Dave scoffed, “I should’ve killed him yesterday. The bastard tricked me.”
“What do you mean?”
“He’s no kid.” 
“Just listen to his voice. That sounds like a kid to you?” 
Dave looked pretty agitated. “He woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t stop screaming ever since. I tried to ask him questions from outside the door, and man, his lips are tight.” 
“He told me something in the end, probably because he can’t withstand your illusion anymore.”
They chatted while walking downstairs. “He seems like an eight-year-old kid, right? No! He’s 18. He said something about his growth stopped when he reached the age of seven when his ability awoke.” 
“He didn’t tell me his name, nor the reason why he started stealing. But he mentioned someone that he has to find.”
Dave punched the air. “An 18-year-old, grown-up asshole! I should really…”
They came to the kitchen and Angor started to prepare their meal while Dave was still cursing the Phantom Servant.
Angor sliced some pancake and found some milk, somewhat unfocused at his task. He was thinking about Dave’s words.
So the Phantom Servant child-no, Phantom Servant young man, didn’t grow in the body since the age of seven.
Angor recalled that Sunders once mentioned something about how “not everyone with special powers is favored by this world”.
Angor began to understand Sunders’ words now. Dripping River tended to fall asleep a lot, and now this Phantom Servant was left with a child’s body forever… 
This could also be the very basic rule in the wizarding world—equivalent exchange.
Something unknown out there always maintained such a rule. If someone gained something, he or she had to lose something in return. 
And sometimes this was not optional.

The Phantom Servant probably did not have a choice when he gained the ability of “Void Shift” in exchange for his future growth.
At least Angor would not accept an exchange like that. Growth on the body was necessary as it brought many new forms of development in one’s life.
It was evolution.
Despite his real age, the Phantom Servant still seemed like a kid, both body and mind.

To Angor, gaining a natural ability at the cost of body growth was a really bad deal. 
A Peter Pan might gain sympathy from mortals, but his talent would not help him survive in the brutal wizarding world. Besides, this was Midnight Sovereign, the home of merciless criminals.
Angor and Dave finished their meal and put the matter of the Phantom Servant behind. They still had their own business to attend to.
Angor was going to search for materials outside, while Dave went into the basement to arrange things to be taken back to Brute Cavern.
Again, Angor took Toby by placing him inside his chest pocket in a comfortable position. 
Toby would not refuse the chance to take it easy in the warmth of his young master.
At the entrance of the base, Angor saw Prome returning with a frustrated look.
Prome did not come back the last night. His expression suggested that his search went in vain.
Angor went to greet Prome, who proved his assumption.
“I checked every alchemy shop in Twilight Well, as well as several private meetings. Nothing.”
“There are weapons for close combats, but not long-range ones. And none of the melee weapons will satisfy my friend.”
Prome sighed helplessly. “Looks like I must rely on Twilight Auction… although I’m not expecting anything from it.”
“Have faith, sir, we’ll find something,” said Angor as he comforted him.
He was going to draw Prelude to Elimination anyway, Angor thought to himself.
“Let’s hope so.” 
Prome forced a bitter smile. “So, are you going to buy materials?” 
“Want me to come with you? Some of the alchemy shops are hidden from plain sight, so you need someone to guide you there.” 
“They always sell better things.”
Angor looked at Prome’s tired look and shook his head. “I only need cheap materials such as Echo Flowers.” 
“Besides, I need to save money to attend the auction this evening.”
“I see. Then I’ll show you to those shops tomorrow,” said Prome with a grin. “You can go hire mortals in Midnight Sovereign if you have a lot of things to carry.”
“Mortals can enter Twilight Well too?”
“Yes, if a wizard is with them.” 
“When their job’s done, they’ll forget almost everything that happened in here as if it was a dream.”
“Wow. Wizardry never ceases to amaze.”
Angor bid farewell to Prome and entered another path on his own.
Prome watched Angor’s back with a meaningful look until the boy disappeared from sight.
Nobility houses gathered near the center of Midnight Sovereign.
Inside a luxurious manor near the palace, a young man walked inside with his head lifted high proudly. An aged butler led him into a study of the family.
“Why are you here?” 
“You found Hobbiton yet?” 
A middle-aged Phantom Servant inside the study spoke. This man shared a similar look with the young man who just came in.
“Father, I found his smell in a small alley, but a wizard took him away.” 
The young man lowered his head when speaking to his father.
“A wizard? Do tell me.”
The young man described what he saw at the scene.
“It was a spell called Frost.” 
“And whoever did it was still a mere apprentice.“ 
”You don’t find real wizards often.”
“But apprentices are still someone we can’t offend,” the young man commented.
“Lady Lotus wants Hobbiton. If we can’t bring Hobbiton to her, a real wizard will send her fury upon us and burn the whole family to the ground.” The middle-aged servant sighed.
They were in an awkward condition where they had to offend the lesser of the two evils. The bane of being Phantom Servants.
“You keep looking for Hobbiton. Lady Lotus will arrive in half a month. I shall tell her about the situation by then. Let’s hope she can forgive us considering all the tributes we offered before.”
Angor followed the path he went yesterday and entered Midnight Sovereign again.
According to Prome, he could buy manpower from anyone he wanted, be it children, women or the old, as long as he paid enough money.
He did not see anyone around the hidden entrance. He only heard the noise of crowds gathering coming from the other side of the wall.
Like Ye Chen, Xu Jing had chosen to close up and train right after the Hidden Dragon Ancient Town. Because of the loud noises from the battle between Ye Chen and Sikong Sheng, she had come out to check what was going on. When she got here, the battle was already over. Jin Huang’s killing vibe was a warning sign for her, which was why she pushed her speed to its limit to block out that incoming attack for Ye Chen.
Jin Huang had trained a Gold element martial art, and even with the most casual attack, it could bring out an unstoppable power, which had easily gone through Xu Jing’s defense layer, breaking all of the bones in both of her arms.
All of that had happened way too suddenly. Ye Chen had just pulled out his Mysterious Zhen Yuan from his dantian, and any sudden move would ruin it all. So, all he could do was watch Xu Jing being blown hundreds of meters away. Luckily, Zhu Mei had rushed out and caught Xu Jing.
"Blood Explosion! Green Lotus Sky!"
Groaning angrily, the bloody zhen Qi outside Ye Chen’s body exploded aggressively. It was the most powerful and most self-damaging martial art from the Minor Blood Demon Body Separating Great Art. Even Yuan Zongbo would not dare to use it, because once one used this attack, there was ninety percent chance to become a martial art impudent, and thirty percent chance to die on the spot, which made it extremely dangerous. For now, once he used the Blood Explosion attack, Ye Chen’s battling power increased again, reaching above eighty percent, which was almost like burning zhen yuan. However, the Mysterious zhen yuan that had been pushed into the meridians on his right arm had been dyed completely a bloody red color, which meant the second he used his Mysterious Zhen Yuan, Ye Chen’s base power would be just as an Early Astral Reaching Realm warrior. Added with his seventy percent sword intent and the ace attack from his Green Lotus Sword Art, it would give him the power to kill a Mid Astral Reaching Realm warrior. As for the Late Astral Reaching Realm warrior he was confronting right now, he would soon find out about its possibility.
Shoo!
The Star Scar Sword in his palm was extra heavy. Ye Chen waved out a sword attack, that seemed really slow but in fact was extremely fast, towards Jin Huang. The boiling air quieted down unnaturally, as a dead silence reigned for a moment. Then, countless green lotuses appeared out of nowhere, taking over the whole space.
"Huh! You really think that kind of kid’s play would beat me? Don’t embarrass yourself! Break!"
Jin Huang made a noise as he lifted up his palm and threw out an attack. That golden light had formed huge palm in the air, tearing up the condensed air, shattering countless green lotuses and creating a pitch-black vacuum pathway. That vacuum space looked like it contained an extremely large pulling power, which could consume everything around it.
Pop!
Blood poured out of every part of Ye Chen’s body, and the aura of the blood filled the air.
Right then, his body suddenly shook. His Green Lotus Sword Spell, which was stuck in the peak level of the ninth realm, had reached the tenth realm under that extreme pressure. Meanwhile, his own cultivation had also made a huge progress. He had not only reached the peak level of his Late Clasping Yuan Realm, but the space between producing zhen yuan had also been shortened as well.Ye Chen had finally understood deeply that only with extreme pressure would he be able to push up his battling power. Only a life and death situation could spark a breakthrough.
"Green Lotus Accumulation! Kill!"
Without showing any excitement, Ye Chen looked extremely serious, his eyes like eagles’, locking onto Jin Huang. Right then, his Mysterious Zhen Yuan had already been poured into his Star Scar Sword. The latter had burst out with an unbearably bright light. A fist-sized Green Lotus suddenly appeared on the tip of his sword. Then, a flower blossomed on top of the green lotus, surrounded by countless bloody streams like Qi flow, which could easily cut open space.
As Ye Chen threw out that sword attack, that fist-sized green lotus was shot out at a scary speed, dragging a straight black line in the air. It carried on moving and spreading out for hundreds of meters, which made it look like it had split the whole space into two parts, which was extremely horrifying.
"Oh, dang. How did this brat get zhen yuan?"
If it was only zhen yuan, Jin Huang would not even blink an eye and would be able to kill his opponent with a flick of his finger. However, Ye Chen had just performed the Blood Explosion attack, which had combined his zhen yuan and his Qi and blood, which would be equivalent to burning zhen yuan, bringing his attacking power to the next level. Nonetheless, if it were just that, then it would still be an easy fight for him. But Ye Chen was a sword artist, with seventy percent sword intent. Combining all the factors together, even a Mid Astral Reaching Realm warrior would be killed if he were reckless. Earlier, he did not care about the Sky Cloud Martial School at all, so he had only used around sixty percent of his zhen yuan, not to even mention burning his zhen yuan.
Right now, his defense could not even compare to a Mid Astral Reaching Realm warrior’s zhen yaun layer. If he were hit by that sword attack, it would be lucky that he was not killed.
The green lotus shot out too fast, and Jin Huang did not have time to increase his zhen yuan layer. So, he had to point out his finger and throw out an attack.
"Jin Huang Finger Attack!"
It was his exclusive martial art. Even with only sixty percent of power, its attacking power would incomparable to normal Astral Reaching Realm warriors.
Shoo!
The golden light shot out in the air and clashed with that twisting green lotus. 
Without any sound or light, the two stuck to each other like two pieces of magnets.
Everyone there watching was not used to what had happened. It was like they had known about the incoming thunder and had already seen the lighting, but when they had done every preparation, they could not hear it at all. The anti-climax was a bit frustrating.
But this was only for a split second, as a loud sound and bright light burst out and shot out into the sky. It tore apart the dark clouds in the air while that unstoppable firepower carried on attacking. To the spectators, it looked like a fan-like light wall.
As that loud sound was heard, Ye Chen and Jin Huang were blown away backward. What was different was that Ye Chen was puking out blood and his body seemed to shrink in size, while Jin Huang was only a little bit pale, but did not seem to be wounded at all.
The gap between the two’s cultivation was just too big, and even if Ye Chen had pushed his limits and burst out with his most powerful attack, the difference was still there. Compared to Jin Huang, who only hurried to fight back, he was still not a rightful opponent at all. However, being able to beat Jin Huang back for hundreds of meters could already prove Ye Chen’s true power.
"Cloud Break Cut!"
"Thunder Attack!"
Cloud Dreamer and Thunder Freer had bit on their tongues, forcing themselves to wake up from the confusion. They pushed their zhen yuan to their limits, performing their most powerful attack against Jin Huang, who had just stopped flying backward. Whether winning or losing, it had all come down to this one second.
"Huh! No matter how many ants there are, you are ants after all. Today, all of you will die. The Sky Cloud Martial School will fall. I will make you all pay."
Ye Chen’s head-on attack had boiled up Jin Huang’s blood and Qi while he tried his best to swallow down that pile of impure blood. Seeing Cloud Dreamer and Thunder Freer coming for him, he was furious. He ignored the potential damage it would cause from forcing zhen yuan and threw out two beams of Jin Huang finger power which were produced under the enhancement of his seventy percent zhen yuan.
Pooh! Pooh!
Even if their two attacks combined were not as powerful as that one attack Ye Chen had just thrown out, it still should not be underestimated. However, this time, Jin Huang had pushed his seventy percent zhen yuan, which was definitely incomparable with that former finger attack. It had shattered the two incoming attacks without a doubt.
Cloud Dreamer forced a laugh, "Brother thunder, I want to ask you a favor. Bring everyone that you can, especially Ye Chen! Leave a bloodline for our Sky Cloud Martial School. Don’t let the school fall completely. Otherwise, I, Cloud Dreamer, will have no face in front of our past leaders/ I will not rest even if I die!"
That last part was almost being yelled out.
Thunder Freer’s face changed, "Cloud, what are you doing?"
"Hurry! We are running out of time! I will use up the last drop of my blood to stall him."
Cloud Dreamer was already not at peace. His zhen yuan was about to explode, and there was no way back for him. His whole body was like a ticking time bomb.
Thunder Freer shook his head and sighed. A dying wish was growing in his body as he yelled at Cloud Dreamer, "There’s no chance of running now. Look!"
Following his sight, he saw Ye Chen flying back again. His robes were covered with blood, and even his hair were dripping blood.
"Senior Cloud Dreamer, Senior Thunder Freer, I know what you are thinking. But I will not run. Sacrificing the whole Sky Cloud Martial School for my life, what would be the use of me living after that? That horrifying trauma would haunt me forever, and I will never be able to reach the Life and Death Realm, which would only be against your wishes. I do not want to have that weight over my shoulder. I, Ye Chen, had decided to pick up the sword and I had never thought about running, and definitely never thought about asking someone else to die for me. This whole thing had happened because of me, and it will be dealt with by me. Don’t bother to convince me. I have made up my mind."
As he talked, Ye Chen had taken out a huge amount of Blood Sun Flowers, extracted the medicine out from the plants and swallowed it all. He then immediately pushed his Blood Explosion art without holding back. With his bloody body standing in the air, his mind had never been this sharp, his intent had never been this clear. His sword intent shot out into the sky and then carried on shooting upwards. That horrifying sword intent had reached beyond his body’s limit, as his skin started to crack open.
"The peak of the seventy percent sword intent…No! It is the eighty percent sword intent!"
Jin Huang gasped, yelling with all of his power. ‘This brat should not be left alive. Otherwise, he will become someone unstoppable someday.’ Right now, he was already afraid about his future, and knew that if he did not kill Ye Chen now, he would have to be living in fear for the rest of his life.
A lot of the female disciples from the Sky Cloud Martial School started crying. The male disciples started to look determined and stopped thinking about escaping.
"Wu Zongming, I want to go up there. What do you think?"
Zhang Haoran, who was only at the peak level of his Late Condensing Reality Realm, took a step forward, flying into the sky.
Wu Zongming laughed, "Zhang Haoran, do not underestimate me. Do you really think I am someone who would run away?"
Soon, the rest of the people from the Sky Cloud Martial School had gathered around. The ones who could fly flew into the sky and stood right by Cloud Dreamer and the group. The ones who could not fly yet stood on the ground.
Right then, the Sky Cloud Martial School had never been this powerful and united. Everyone’s Qi and mind had come together naturally, and eventually turned into a reckless aura.
"Zhu Mei, let’s go!" 
Xu Jing, who was being held by Zhu Mei, said quietly.
Zhu Mei’s eyes started to tear up as she nodded lightly. Luo Hanshan laughed lightly, but no one knew what it meant. They only knew that his smile was very bright and warm as he flew up into the sky with Zhu Mei.
Looking at the crowd from the Sky Cloud Martial School, Jin Huang was not in a good mood. He had never seen something like this before. In his imagination, the Sky Cloud Martial School should be full of useless, weak disciples.
"Then, you shall all die!"
Jin Huang yelled. His zhen yuan started to burn drastically. That horrifying Qi spread out in the whole place, which eventually turned into a wave of extremely heavy wind. It had torn apart the earth, and shattered the mountains. A shiny golden flame released by him seemed like a golden sun.
"Jin Huang Sun Break!"
A highly-condensed light ball appeared on his fingertip. Jin Huang believed that once this pile of light ball exploded, all of those who had not got enough power would die instantly.
Right then, a light sigh was heard. It was like right next to everyone’s ear, but also seemed extremely far away. The sound carried on spreading and vibrating. Soon, the gray sky brightened up. In everyone’s sight, a mountain-sized huge palm was seen pressed down. It had covered the sun completely, covering the whole sky. The prints of that palm were extremely detailed and clear. No one had seen anything like this before.
As if thousands of thunder shocks were bursting out under the ground, the earth was shaking violently. The drilling machine that the demon clan built up rose up a little bit at first, before it was pulled down and exploded in cracking noises.
Then, a cluster of high-pressure fog erupted from the hole and broke out in the sky into thousands of pieces of ice.
"Not good. A frigorific cyclone!"
Hong Tong's voice was somewhat hoarse.
They did not know that the demons were drilling in this place just to get a frigorific cyclone out.
They'd witnessed the power of frigorific cyclones with their own eyes the other day. A battleground of more than ten square kilometers could be entirely frozen by one of them. It was extremely tricky for Building Foundation Stage Cultivators such as themselves to cope with them.
The question now was how big the incoming frigorific cyclone would be.
Li Yao's pupils constricted violently as he thought of something. He said in a hurry, "It's not simple as that. It's impossible that the demons came such a long way here just to pick up a cluster of frigorific cyclone!"
Before he was able to finish his sentence, the frigorific cyclone seemed to have woken up from a prolonged dream. It cycled through various forms in the sky, before it twisted and condensed into a cerulean cloud of ice dozens of meters in diameter with bright blue streaks.
Although its size was smaller than they had imagined, its temperature was much lower. Everyone's crystal suit was beeping with warnings even though they were all dozens of meters away, strongly suggesting that they get out of there as soon as possible.
The blue streaks stared at everyone like long, narrow eyes.
They were all grasped by fear.
"It's a Devastating Icy Revenant! One with such a tremendous size!" 
Yan Yangtian murmured to herself.
Everyone's hearts were frozen like an ice tube.
Devastating Icy Revenants were the last bit of the fighting will of the deceased combined with the energy leaked from the frigorific cyclones that could only come into being after hundreds of years.
Li Yao and his teammates had run into several Devastating Icy Revenants yesterday in the underground tunnels, which were like translucent hairtails. Even the largest of them was only the length of an arm.
But this Devastating Icy Revenant was hundreds of times larger, which seemed to be capable of devouring all of them at the same time.
It appeared that someone strong must've participated in the war on the ancient battleground and left an intense sense of slaughtering at the last moment of their life. By accident, his mental power infiltrated into the main conduit of the frigorific cyclones and, after thousands of years of melting, created such a gargantuan Devastating Icy Revenant.
The demons might've discovered it dozens of years ago. Now that the conditions were just right, they were planning to dig it out and save it for their use. 
But Team Blue Bronze had appeared out of nowhere and disrupted their plan. Having no other choice, they were forced to release the Devastating Icy Revenant earlier, hoping to die together with their opponents.
All the demons that were still alive were dancing in wild joy upon seeing the appearance of the Devastating Icy Revenant, while they shouted with twisted faces, 
"Embrace me, Pantheon of Demons!"
Like puffing cheeks, the Devastating Icy Revenant expanded suddenly, before it suddenly shrank and blew out a stream of ice that was visible to everyone. The demons, standing in the middle of the stream of ice, were immediately solidified into transparent sculptures in their dancing postures. The limbs of two demons who were moving too quickly dropped down the moment of the solidification. But the fracture was neat and clean like mirror, without the slightest hint of blood.
The natural instinct of Devastating Icy Revenants was to freeze everything they saw, especially the living creatures.
After freezing all the remaining demons, the cerulean cloud of ice drifted to Team Blue Bronze without pause.
"Let me!"
Ding Lingdang stepped forward and crossed her arms. The fire serpents were twisted into a helix and thrown at the Devastating Icy Revenant.
Like boiling oil pouring into snow, cracking noises burst out inside the cloud of ice.
The bright blue streaks twitched violently, as if thousands of eyes which were squinting out of sharp pain.
Then, five blue ice balls were ejected from the Devastating Icy Revenant.
"Watch out!"
Li Yao reacted quickly enough to push Ding Lingdang away. The two of them rolled on the ground, and five thick ice spears were standing in the exact place where Ding Lingdang had been standing.
Had Li Yao not taken action promptly, Ding Lingdang would've definitely been injured by the ice spears, if not frozen by them.
The Devastating Icy Revenant, on the other hand, chewed the fire serpents before freezing them, and continued drifting at Team Blue Bronze.
"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"
Four flowers of flame blossomed on the right side of the Devastating Icy Revenant, which were soon turned into frosty flowers.
They were the incendiary bullets that 'Shell' Leng Ziming shot out!
A hissing sound like that of gas leaking out could be heard from the inside of the Devastating Icy Revenant. It seemed to be in great pain. Suddenly, four ice cones darted out to where the bullets had come from, leaving four vague traces of ice in the air.
A moment later, clusters of ice grew out on the ridge where Leng Ziming had been hiding.
"Shell!" 
Hong Tong shouted.
"I'm fine. The plate armor of the right leg has been damaged with a performance reduction of 52%. Moving on to the second shooting position."
Leng Ziming's voice was as calm as ever.
"Alright, cover us in the second shooting position. Let's fall back!"
The appearance of this super-large Devastating Icy Revenant was beyond everyone's expectations. Now that neither the long-range point of attack nor the melee one had any solution to deal with it, Hong Tong immediately made the call to retreat to the Heaven's Origin Sector as soon as possible.
His manipulation of gravity couldn't be more useful at this moment. He lifted up giant stones and placed them between Team Blue Bronze and the Devastating Icy Revenant, while he lowered the gravity around them to one third of the standard gravity.
All members of Team Blue Bronze covered each other up with furious firepower according to the retreat plans that they'd practiced during training.
Yet, the Devastating Icy Revenant was staying close behind them. Floating in the sky like a cloud, it was astonishingly fast, and since it was so high, it was very easy to locate their route.
Now and then, it would spit out clusters of high-pressure ice fog like arrows so powerful that as soon as they touched one corner of the plate armor, the whole part of the plate armor would immediately be frozen and lose all functionality.
Everyone activated their power rune arrays and sprinted across the ice-covered world. After taking several turns through ridges and caves, they finally managed to get rid of the Devastating Icy Revenant.
"Let's go back to the star shuttle!" 
Hong Tong said hurriedly. 
Sweat was appearing on their forehead, which was instantly frozen into ice drops. The spiritual stamps of flame on their bodies were barely of any use now.
However, when they finally reached the valley where their star shuttle was hidden and were ready to board it, an arrow of ice darted close from the sky and froze the star shuttle into a giant ice block!
The Devastating Icy Revenant that they thought they'd escaped from was eyeing them in the sky among other ordinary clouds.
Everyone's faces were drawn and couldn't look more awful.
To shatter the void in such a star shuttle would be like committing suicide; 
the components of the star shuttle were, most likely, seriously damaged by the frost and their hardiness greatly undermined. 
And that was assuming the star shuttle could be unfrozen at all.
Their only hope was ruined. There was no help in Mystic Glacier that they could count on to cope with the Devastating Icy Revenant.
Even if the Heaven's Origin Sector sent out a second star shuttle, the Devastating Icy Revenant could destroy it easily.
There was but silence in the communication channel, as if it had been frozen by the Devastating Icy Revenant, too.
Shortly after, Li Yao's voice struggled in the channel, like flickering embers in the darkest cave.
"Let's go back!
"The demon generals that we encountered just now were weaker than us.” 
“They should be scared of the Devastating Icy Revenant as much as we are. It's not like they were trying to kill themselves here.
"If they knew that such a strong Devastating Icy Revenant was hiding underground and were planning to release it, they were definitely carrying something that could suppress it!"
"But since they ran into us, they never had the opportunity to use it!"
As if awoken from their dreams, everyone came back to themselves. 
Hong Tong gritted his teeth and said, "Li Yao, Lingdang, you two go back and look for that something. The four of us will try to lure the Devastating Icy Revenant away.” 
“But make it fast. The Devastating Icy Revenant seems to be absorbing the coldness in Mystic Glacier and getting larger and larger. We won't be able to hold it for long!"
"Understood!"
The six members of Team Blue Bronze rushed for a while, before they suddenly split into two squads and ran off in different directions.
The Devastating Icy Revenant hesitated for a moment, then chased after the squad which had more people as they expected.
Li Yao and Ding Lingdang rushed back to the battleground hundreds of kilometers away as quickly as possible without bothering about their consumption of spiritual energy.
Glancing around, Li Yao immediately discovered the corpse of the demon in glamourous clothes. He kicked it into pieces of ice.
As he expected, there was a piece of magical equipment the shape of a sea snail in the middle of the ice.
Since the magical equipment was supposed to be used to suppress the Devastating Icy Revenant, it was quite possible that it was cold-proof. Therefore, Li Yao had decided to find it out in the simplest way.
However…
Li Yao had never seen such a kind of magical equipment before; he had no idea how to use it at all.
In the communication channel, Hong Tong and his other teammates were breathing heavily. Ba Weiqi was even screaming crazily. Every sign indicated that they wouldn't be able to hold out for long.
Taking a deep breath, Li Yao took out the maintenance glove that Ding Lingdang had given him. He crumbled it in his palm. Silver liquid instantly flowed out from the gaps of the finger of the crystal suit and formed a silver glove enveloping his hand, while dozens of disassembling and maintaining tools appeared in his fingertips.
Li Yao's right hand turned into a streak of silver and dismantled the sea-snail-shaped magical equipment into the most fundamental components.
Demon Beast Empire was based on the ancient Cultivation world. Much of its technology and secret arts were similar to those of the ancient times.
Therefore, the methods through which the demon clan refined magical equipment and demonic equipment were greatly influenced by the ancient refining arts which Li Yao was quite familiar with.
Li Yao's eyes were shaking back and forth dozens of times per second, as he was identifying the components of this particular magical equipment while picturing the design and spiritual energy flowchart in his brain.
"So, this is the case. The key component of this magical equipment is a Cosmos Ring that was made to suppress unrested souls. It has undergone major modifications so that it is functional in the frigid temperature of less than minus two hundred degrees. The special spiral vibration that it triggers can raise a massive attraction force for souls and icy fog…"
"This magical equipment can only be activated by the blood of silver-blood demons. But it doesn't matter. I can totally design a new triggering component and cut it in to activate the magical equipment by force!"
Li Yao was fascinated by the idea, his eyes shining.
"Vulture, we can't delay it any longer. Have you found anything that can tame it?" 
Hong Tong bellowed exhaustedly.
"I have."
Li Yao licked his lips and crossed his fingers. Every joint in his hand was shivering rapidly, as he declared confidently, "Get it here. I need… 4 minutes and 38 seconds!"
“Stop thinking. As far as I know, the holy hands can cure your illness. After holy hands, it comes to doctors of divinity.”
Xu Miaolin, knowing exactly what Fang Qiu was thinking, added before sitting back down into the chair.
“However, doctors of divinity are only in myths and legends.”
“The Chinese Medicine circle is so complicated.”
Fang Qiu smiled wryly.
“I have some data here.”
Xu Miaolin continued with a beam, “Since you are interested, I’ll tell you as well.”
Upon hearing that.
Fang Qiu calmed himself down and waited to hear more patiently.
“At present, there are 500,000 registered Chinese Medicine doctors in China. However, only 1,253 of them are approved doctors of ingenuity by the Chinese Medicine circle. There are 451 qualified doctors of brightness, 50 doctors of greatness, and only 3 holy hands.”
Xu Miaolin explained with a smile, “These are the four levels of the Chinese Medicine circle. To cure your illness, besides promoting yourself through the levels, you also need to master acupuncture and moxibustion, chiropractic, skin scraping, boneset, Qigong, fire therapy, herbal bath, and folk remedy as well as Taoist elixirs and spells and Buddhist chants. You’ve got a long way to go!”
Fang Qiu knew too well that there was still a long way to go. But at that moment something else had him puzzled.
“But why do I have to attend tests of the Chinese Medicine association constantly?”
They circled back to the beginning.
Why did he need to be approved and acknowledged by the Chinese Medicine circle to treat the old master’s illness?
Xu Miaolin had been explaining the levels and divisions of the Chinese Medicine circle but that question was not answered.
“Simple.”
Xu Miaolin asked back, “Would the Chinese Medicine circle approve you if you didn’t attend any test?”
“I guess not.”
Answered Fang Qiu.
“Without acknowledgement from the Chinese Medicine circle, you won’t be able to get those unique copies on Chinese Medicine not in circulation in the market and only known by very few.”
Xu Miaolin added, “These unique copies are the true essence and precious gems of the Chinese Medicine circle. So precious that they are only shared within the approved group of Chinese Medicine doctors.”
“Doctors of ingenuity have their unique copies.”
“Doctors of brightness have their unique copies.”
“The unique copies of each level are concealed within the group, never passed down. Because before reaching the level, one won’t be able to understand them; instead, one’s study in Chinese Medicine might get interrupted.”
Confused, Fang Qiu asked with a frown.
“Then why are they not in circulation?”
“We might not be able to understand them before reaching the level but why can’t those in the know teach or instruct? If they don’t want to teach, they could translate these unique copies into plainer words for the ordinary to understand and spread them out to give more people access.”
“Inappropriate!”
Xu Miaolin shook his head in disagreement. “Many unique copies contain theories of Chinese Medicine opposite to our current understanding. Once they are in circulation, adverse effect will be caused.”
Now Fang Qiu finally got it.
“The one I gave you to read is a unique copy I have got.”
Xu Miaolin’s voice sounded.
“That’s a unique copy?”
Fang Qiu was shocked!
The one that granted him the Bonesetting Theory was a unique copy!
This unique copy was very mighty. Would other unique copies also contain mysterious lost knowledge?
Maybe he didn’t have to become specialized in all fields after all. Mastering the content of some unique copies might be enough to treat the old master’s illness!
The more he thought, the faster his heart beat.
“Most importantly, only approved doctors of greatness are qualified to attend the expert meeting.”
Xu Miaolin just dropped another shock bomb.
Doctors of greatness?
Fang Qiu was astonished.
Only doctors of greatness are qualified. So he had to become a doctor of greatness within one and a half years?
Is it possible?
“Teacher Xu, may I ask which level are you at in the Chinese Medicine circle?”
Fang Qiu quickly looked up at Xu Miaolin as he asked.
“Me?”
Xu Miaolin chuckled. Instead of answering, he raised one hand and began to draw in the air.
Looking carefully.
Fang Qiu saw Xu Miaolin write the character “Greatness” in the air.
Doctor of greatness!
I knew it!
He knew Xu Miaolin was very good but didn’t expect him to be one of the 50 doctors of greatness across the country.
With knowledge of the levels of the Chinese Medicine circle and all the tests for promotion, he knew clearly what this title represented.
He had a thorough understanding of at least three fields. How impressive! Very, very impressive!
So if he wanted to read other unique copies like the Bonesetting Theory, he had to become a doctor of greatness?
As he pondered, the frown climbed back to Fang Qiu’s brows.
The doctor of greatness level seemed to have become a ridge that he couldn’t pass.
“Hmm…”
Before Fang Qiu could throw out his question, Xu Miaolin cut in, “Don’t bother ask me about the meeting location. I won’t tell you. No one will tell you.” 
“Either to attend the meeting or to cure your illness, you must become a doctor of greatness within one and a half years!”
Fang Qiu let out a long sigh.
Seeking his help seemed impossible.
He turned to Xu Miaolin solemnly and put on his most sincere tone.
“Teacher Xu!”
“May I study Chinese Medicine with you? The school has this Apprentice Plan program. Can you be my master?”
He locked his eyes on Xu Miaolin.
Xu Miaolin glanced at Fang Qiu and then shook his head slightly. “Becoming my apprentice won’t be necessary.”
“Chinese medicine is a long journey of 5,000 kilometers. You need to cure at least ten thousand patients and visit a dozen brilliant masters along the way. I have some understanding in all fields but my knowledge is too miscellaneous, not refined. I can help you with Chinese Medicine knowledge but I can’t hold you up by becoming your mentor.”
Fang Qiu was startled.
He didn’t expect Xu Miaolin to decline so directly.
He attempted to try again!
Xu Miaolin continued after a moment of thought, “However, since you are very determined in learning Chinese Medicine, I don’t mind guide you a bit and teach you a few things. I can even teach you by the hand like a master as well as take you to attend the tests of the Chinese Medicine circle.”
Fang Qiu was overjoyed.
That was a yes!
“But we need to take a test first.”
Out of blue, Xue Miaolin added, “And we need money!”
“How much?”
Asked Fang Qiu hastily.
Although poor, he couldn’t let go this opportunity.
There was no other teacher in this school like Xu Miaolin.
To become specialized in all fields, he might not be able to find a better master than Xu Miaolin throughout the Chinese medicine circle!
“300,000!”
Xu Miaolin showed three fingers with a half smile.
300,000…
Fang Qiu gave a bitter smile upon the answer.
He still owed someone 1,000. Where could he get 300,000?
However!
This money he was willing to pay!
He would figure out some way to get the money.
He just couldn’t miss this opportunity!
Once let go, he would have little chance finding another teacher good as him.
“This money is to make you pay.”
Xu Miaolin glanced at Fang Qiu’s wry smile and explained, “The outstanding are often arrogant.”
“I had washed my master’s feet for three years before he accepted me as his apprentice. You don’t have to wash my feet but you’ll pay me to show your filial respect!”
“It is said that wealth moves hearts. We must move your heart. You pay first and then you can study Chinese Medicine better.”
“Things that can be easily got are often easily lost. The most precious are always the ones you can’t get. And those hard to get are more cherished.”
At that point.
Xu Miaolin suddenly changed his tone with some laughter. “All masters live off their apprentices. Otherwise, why do we take on students? Maybe I’ll give every penny back when you become a master.”
“Deal! How much time do I have?”
Fang Qiu looked up and asked bluntly without hesitation.
“You’ve already made up your mind?”
Xu Miaolin said with a smile, “300,000 is not a small amount. Don’t you want to do the maths and figure out how long it will take you to earn that money back by practicing medicine?”
Fang Qiu shook his head at the question and replied, “I want to learn, not to make money!”
Xu Miaolin nodded his satisfaction.
Well said. To learn, not to make money.
Not many doctors in the present Chinese Medicine circle still hold this opinion.
More and more students are coming into Chinese Medicine these days and many switch to Chinese Medicine half way in their career. Which one of them is not here for a good job in the future?
Not to make money by practicing Chinese Medicine?
How many students of Chinese Medicine dare say this?
“One month. 300,000.”
Shen Miaolin said, “Come here tomorrow afternoon. I’ll have you tested.”
“Great!”
Fang Qiu accepted with a nod.
One month. 300,000. For a poor student like him, it would be as difficult as climbing up to heaven.
But however hard it is, he’ll get the money.
Just to repay the old master’s kindness!
Watching Fang Qiu striding away, Xu Miaolin murmured to himself with a smile, “Can’t wait to see how much potential I can push out of you. No one has reached the doctor of greatness level in one and a half years.”
“Incurable illness and high debts. I might be creating a genius!”
“I’m looking forward to it!”
Away from the reading room, Fang Qiu headed towards the cafeteria.
He returned to the dorm after dinner.
Fang Qiu had no evening classes that day so he stayed in the dorm reading.
But his heart couldn’t find peace.
“What shall I do?”
Sitting on his bed with his legs crossed, Fang Qiu racked his brains for ideas.
300,000 was not a small number for him.
Actually it wouldn’t be a small number for any student.
He needed to make 300,000 within one month.
But how?
He was very troubled.
How could he make this amount of money?
After over one hour, he had run through all possible, reasonable methods but nothing could work.
Sun Hao, Zhou Xiaotian, and Zhu Benzheng returned when Fang Qiu was terribly distressed.
“The third oldest, we better hurry or we’ll miss the tickets.”
Said Zhu Benzheng as he entered.
“Don’t you worry.”
Taking his seat by the desk, Sun Hao turned on his laptop with a beam. “I’m a well-known ticket grabber. No ticket I can’t get. Tonight I’ll get the tickets for us even if I have to stay up all night.”
He took action at once.
“Where are you guys going?”
Hearing the trio’s discussion, Fang Qiu put aside his worry and asked.
“What’s up?”
Sun Hao looked up at Fang Qiu and chuckled. “The youngest, are you coming with us?”
“No.”
Fang Qiu shook his head at once and answered with a bitter smile, “I’m too poor. Plus, I have to work in the hospital this Sunday.”
“You are working this holiday?”
Zhou Xiaotian turned around and asked curiously.
“What can I do? My people need me!”
Fang Qiu tried to appear concerned about his country and his people.
“Pooh!”
Zhou Xiaotian put all his sneer into this boo.
“We are going to Mount Taishan. Are you sure you are not going?”
Asked Sun Hao as he entered his password for the train ticket website.
“I can’t.”
Fang Qiu nodded.
However, his heart was in a trance.
Mount Taishan?
Sun Hao’s words reminded him of something.
He remembered how the old master found a plant of herb from Mount Taishan and identified it as one of the earth treasures.
At that time.
He thought that was some common Chinese herb. Later on he realized that the old master picked that herb to suppress his injury.
That day Fang Qiu learned from the old master that the heaven materials and earth treasures were not just items in legends. They actually existed in this world.
If Zhang Suya had not shot herself in the foot and angered Mrs. Yue today, he would not have known anything until the day he died. He would have been supporting someone else’s child until his dying day, supporting a paramour.
Helan Mingde had believed Zhang Suya wholeheartedly then. Now he hated her—he hated her so much that he wanted to kill her in the cruelest way possible. He had been played by this b*tch for thirty years—thirty years!
With all the anger and hatred in him, Helan Mingde was beginning to think that Helan Xiuse did not resemble him at all when he looked at her. The more he looked, the more he thought she did not resemble him—the more he felt that this was definitely not his daughter. She was a baseborn child!
Helan Xiuse saw Helan Mingde’s vicious eyes and felt as though he would murder her in the very next second.
“Dad…Dad…I’m your daughter,” she said hurriedly, enduring the pain. “Did you forget that we have the same blood type? I’m A-type. You even gave your blood to me.”
Helan Mingde paused for a moment.
“Hah. A-type? So what?” a nosy man chuckled immediately. “Maybe your wife’s man is A-type too?” 
“There are so many A-type men in the world. Are they all her father?” 
“Then I’m one of them too.”
“Blood type isn’t the key to verifying paternity—it’s DNA.”
“That’s right. I’m an A-type too.”
“Shut up. Shut up…” Helan Xiuse shrieked, crying.
Tears streaked her entire face. “Dad…I know that I look disagreeable to you now, I know that you’re angry, but…But please calm down. I’m begging you. Don’t let yourself be controlled by rage. Everybody said that brother looks just like you when you were younger. Did you forget?” 
“My brother has always been your son.
“Mom is clever. If she could think of a way to get rid of her first child, which was not your child, why would she let a child that wasn’t yours stay in the Helan family? If she did, wouldn’t she have planted a ticking time bomb for herself? Mom wouldn’t do this. She wouldn’t be so stupid…”
There was logic in Helan Xiuse’s words. It stunned Helan Mingde for a moment.
“It’s okay if you suspect me,” Helan Xiuse continued quickly. “I won’t blame you. You’ll always be my dearest Dad. But…Dad, I can’t go along with you. I can’t take these false accusations. I’ll prove my innocence to you.”
She turned her head. Her bloodshot eyes were as vicious as a vengeful ghost’s. She glared at everyone, then she focused her attention on Yan Qingsi. “All of you are the instigators of my death,” she said. “I’ll never forgive you even if I become a spirit…”
When she was done, the crowd watched as Helan Xiuse grabbed a dagger-like shard of glass from the floor, clenched her teeth, and drew a deep line over her wrist.
The crowd gasped in shock. No one could imagine that Helan Xiuse would slit her wrists to commit suicide, especially when killing oneself was not easy to do.
Helan Xiuse cried silently. Her tears rolled down in big, fat drops. “Dad…I’ll use my death to prove their lies to you,” she said. “I’m really your daughter. I’m not lying to you…”
Bright red blood flowed out of the deeply cut wrist.
Yan Qingsi narrowed her eyes. She would survive because she cornered herself into this situation. She actually dared to do this to herself. Helan Xiuse was even more vicious than her mother!
From her actions today, her plans and her schemes, she was probably a cut above even Mrs. Helan. She had always pretended to be idiotic, innocent. She was actually a top-notch wolf clothed in sheep’s clothing.
